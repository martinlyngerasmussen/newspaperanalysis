{"title": "Business", "date": "1 January 2016", "body": "Hong Kong-listed mainland developers signalled a return to issuing bonds in the domestic market this year and this naturally resulted in a rapid decline of issuance in offshore bonds. The offshore new bond issuance volume dropped 50 per cent to US$12.3 billion in the first 11 months in 2015, researcher Dealogic data shows, while onshore issuance surged 43 per cent to US$62.4 billion. As part of efforts to boost property investment, Chinese authorities reopened the domestic bond market to developers last year. The new rules allow developers to issue corporate bonds of which the value should be no more than 40 per cent of a company's net assets, through the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The other way is in private placement bonds through the stock exchanges which will grant a certain quota to a developer in terms of its domestic ratings. Analysts said most developers didn't begin issuing domestic bonds until the second half of this year. Tony Chen, a property credit analyst at Nomura International (Hong Kong), said few developers have used up their quotas, especially through private placement, and there would be room for them to further borrow money through domestic channels in 2016. Developers are attracted by the low funding costs. Mainland Chinese developers have been struggling to save on financing costs as land prices have surged in recent years. One way to do is through cheap domestic funding which has helped developers largely trim those costs. As an example, Country Garden, one of the largest homebuilders in China, issued a 3 billion yuan domestic corporate bond with coupon rate 4.2 per cent in August, compared to its 7.5 per cent dollar bond issued early this year. Leading developers include China Vanke, Evergrande Real Estate and Longfor Properties have also enjoyed paying coupons in the domestic market that are nearly half those on their offshore dollar bonds this year. The trend has lured more Hong Kong- listed mainland developers back onshore and Jefferies' data shows the sector's average borrowing costs have declined 1 to 2 percentage points as a result. \u0093We want to take advantage of this window and raise more capital domestically,\u0094 said Ryan Hui, chief financial officer of mid-sized developer Yuzhou Properties, which issued two domestic bonds this year. \u0093The possible yuan depreciation will make the offshore dollar bond cost higher,\u0094 Hui added. He said domestic liquidity remains more than sufficient as market demand for high grade credit bonds is strong. Global rating agency Standard & Poor's expect the domestic bond market will remain open in 2016 as the industry is still on the way to recovery. Offshore investors have tried to offer low rates to lure developers back to the market but analysts said the market will likely keep shrinking in 2016. Shanghai-based developer Future Land development successfully placed a 6.25 per cent US$250 million senior note last month, saving four percentage points from its previous offshore borrowing, followed by more developers issuing their cheapest-ever offshore bonds in the past month. Nomura's Chen said it is unlikely the rate of offshore property bonds would be lowered further in the market. \u0093The offshore bond market will shrink further,\u0094 Chen said. \u0093Developers may only use offshore channels for refinancing existing debts.\u0094 Despite the quick move to the mainland bond market, Hong Kong listed developers are aware of the potential policy risk and stressed that they would maintain a good relationship with overseas investors to hedge those risk. \u0093It is not good to just appear when you need money,\u0094 said Kenny Chan, executive director of Future Land development.

{"title": "Business", "date": "31 December 2015", "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia\u0097Malaysian state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. Thursday said it had agreed to sell a majority stake in a Kuala Lumpur real-estate project to a consortium that includes a state-owned Chinese company for 7.41 billion ringgit ($1.72 billion), the second time in recent weeks that a Chinese firm has helped 1MDB cut its debt pile. The involvement of China Railway Engineering Corp., the Malaysian unit of China Railway Group Ltd., in the winning consortium comes at a time when it is competing with Japanese firms for a contract to build a high-speed rail link between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. China Railway Engineering Managing Director Cai Zemin said at a news conference announcing the deal that the company would try its best to get the railway project. Malaysia has previously said any tender would based on internationally recognized standards. Thursday's agreement closely follows 1MDB's move to sell energy assets for $2.3 billion to \\b Chinese\\b0  state-owned firmChina General Nuclear Power Corp., which will also assume 7.43 billion ringgit of the debt held by the energy unit, Edra Global Energy. The property sale, meanwhile, is for a 60% stake in Bandar Malaysia, the site of an old air force base on the edge of Kuala Lumpur's city center. It is one of two prime plots of land in the capital that 1MDB bought from the government and planned to develop into a mixed shopping, residential and entertainment center. 1MDB will retain a 40% stake in the development. It also wholly owns another city center development, Tun Razak Exchange, named for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's father. In a statement Thursday, the state-run firm, whose advisory board is chaired by Mr. Najib, said that \u0093today's agreement marks the final major milestone in the 1MDB rationalization plan. It expects the cash deal to be completed by the end of June next year. Mr. Najib said the deal to sell Bandar Malaysia meant that 1MDB's major challenges were now behind it. \u0093Now it is time for us to await the outcomes of the inquiries into the company; to take note of any lessons that need to be learned; and to move on together in a constructive manner, he said in a New Year's statement. Some opposition politicians, however, said the planned sale risked selling off valuable state assets to pay off debts accrued by what they say is 1MDB's reckless expansion in recent years. \u0093Today's agreement has confirmed my earlier fears that 1MDB's financial troubles will drag the nation into selling off crucial national assets, to pay off the sovereign fund's massive debts, said Rafizi Ramli, secretary-general of the People's Justice Party. 1MDB didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 1MDB has begun selling off assets after accumulating more than $11 billion in debt since its launch in 2009 and becoming the focus of investigations in several countries. Its problems have brought scrutiny to Mr. Najib's role in overseeing 1MDB and have hurt investor confidence in Malaysia's commodities-driven economy, which had already been suffering from fund outflows and falling oil prices. The Wall Street Journal reported in July that government investigators had traced nearly $700 million that had passed through agencies, banks and companies linked to 1MDB to the prime minister's alleged private accounts, but didn't know where the money went. Mr. Najib had denied any wrongdoing or taking money for personal gain, but hasn't explained how the money that was transferred to his alleged accounts was used. He described it to local media as a donation, while his deputy prime minister, Zahid Hamidi, previously said such donations were legal under Malaysian law. The country's anticorruption agency said the money came from a Middle East donor. 1MDB also denied any wrongdoing and said it would cooperate with the investigations. China Railway Engineering is teaming with Malaysian tycoon Lim Kang Hoo's Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Bhd. to buy the stake in Bandar Malaysia, beating other bids from Malaysian groups and interest from the Middle East. Iskandar is also developing a high-end residential and commercial complex in the southern state of Johor, opposite Singapore, and its involvement in the Kuala Lumpur project will help expand its reach in Malaysia. The Bandar Malaysia site is also attractive to China Railway Engineering as it is planned to be the terminus of the proposed high-speed rail line to Singapore. The buyers will also take on all of Bandar Malaysia's obligations, including a 2.4 billion ringgit Islamic bond and the costs of relocating police and military facilities that were on the Bandar Malaysia site, 1MDB President and Group Executive Director Arul Kanda said.

{"title": "Once Again, Oil and  China  Will Test U.S. Bull Run", "date": "31 December 2015", "body": "Global financial markets in 2015 were pulled between two opposing forces: The Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates as the U.S. job market strengthened and pressure for lower interest rates in much of the rest of the world as China's economic growth slowed and commodity prices sank. The results of the tug of war were a soaring dollar, crumbling junk bonds, stubbornly low Treasury yields and a manic-depressive stock market that is ending the year roughly where it started. Those tensions are likely to continue into 2016. The probable result: a global economy that escapes recession, but investors' nerves will be frayed and the bull market in U.S. stocks tested. The first flashpoint to watch is China. Fears that its economy would slow abruptly have persisted for at least a decade and reached a fever pitch in 2015. Small wonder: China's combined private and public debt have surged to 244% of gross domestic product from 148% in 2008, even as growth decelerated to an estimated 6.8% in 2015 from 9.6% in 2008. In August, the world's faith in Chinese macroeconomic management was shaken by the authorities' ham-fisted efforts to stop a stock bubble from deflating, and a bungled loosening of the peg between its currency, the yuan, and the dollar. Global stock markets sold off, and the U.S. market sustained its first correction, or drop of at least 10%, in four years. Beijing's priority in 2016 is to continue the economy's shift toward consumer spending and services from heavy industry and construction, two areas plagued by excess capacity. Since the latter two have been key drivers of investment, an engine of Chinese GDP, this will make it difficult for the government to achieve the 6.5% growth it is expected to target for 2016. A key risk is that major private companies default. The Chinese government should be inclined to let that happen, since it would instill market discipline, though it could also feed fears of contagion. The People's Bank of China may have to cushion the economy by cutting interest rates and allowing the yuan to depreciate further, fueling speculative selling of the yuan and capital flight. But the Chinese authorities' commitment to market forces is highly conditional, and they have shown a proclivity to intervene as needed to prevent contagion and capital flight from degenerating into a broader financial crisis. China is thus likely to once again avoid a hard landing, or growth of less than 4%. This was a year of worrying and waiting. Worrying about China . . . and also waiting for the Fed, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The second flashpoint is oil. Saudi Arabia in 2014 kicked off a price war to recapture market share from American shale-oil producers. In 2015, that war sent oil down more than 30% to around $36.60 a barrel. Even if the drop in oil is mostly over, the geopolitical and financial repercussions are not. In 2015 it roiled the junk-bond market (where shale companies have been heavy borrowers), and in 2016 it could also hit banks that have lent to such companies. In 2016, the country to watch is Saudi Arabia. Plunging oil revenue drove the country's budget deficit to 15% of GDP. The government has responded by paring subsidies for fuel, water and electricity. But as the investment advisory firm BCA Research warns, this risks aggravating social tensions. The kingdom pegs its currency, the riyal, to the dollar. That means as the Federal Reserve raises rates, Saudi Arabia must follow suit. Yet slumping export revenues would normally call for lower rates, and a lower currency. Thus, Saudi Arabia will face pressure to change or abandon the peg. Just as in 2015, the Fed is likely to be a central driver of the markets in 2016. After holding interest rates near zero since 2008, the Fed finally raised them, to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% in December, many months later than it had thought a year earlier. Markets disagreed with the Fed, and still do. Fed officials think their target rate will be between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of 2016 but markets think it won't climb above 1%. The Fed is tightening because it thinks that, with unemployment down to 5%, it's only a matter of time before prices and costs pick up. It's likely to see its judgment affirmed, at least initially. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the typical worker's wage is already growing at a 3.1% pace, up from between 2% and 2.5% in early 2014. Core inflation excluding food and energy, now just 1.3% by the Fed's preferred index, is similarly likely to edge higher as downward pressure from the dollar, oil and health costs dissipate. Pushing back against that are continued low oil prices, which may keep overall inflation below the Fed's 2% target, and the economic drag from weak exports and falling oil and gas investment. With the economic expansion now relatively mature, the bond market could come to worry that Fed tightening will push the economy into recession. By the second half of 2016, the Fed may well agree and call off further tightening. These crosscurrents threaten to make 2016 a down year for stocks. The U.S. bull market is now more than 6 1/2 years old, the fourth-longest on record. It will be a difficult year for many investors, said Jim Caron, global fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, who said the reckoning is largely due to the artificially favorable environment for risk-taking the central bank has created through years of easy-money policies. Age isn't the bull run's only problem. It's also running out of fuel. Per-share profits of companies in the S&P 500 stock index fell an estimated 6% in 2015. Low commodity prices and the high dollar will continue to pressure energy and multinational companies and rising wages will eat into profit margins. Banks could take hits on energy loans. Lackluster profits would be tolerable if stocks were cheap, but they're not. The S&P 500 is trading at a lofty 19.5 times operating earnings, while the Fed is raising interest rates. In the past, the Fed has usually tightened while the economy and profits were accelerating. This time, the economic expansion is mature and profit margins, which rose from 6.2% in 2009 to 9.7% in 2014, are narrowing. Against this backdrop, investors should be relieved if the U.S. bull market survives another year. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "China  Warns Its Insurers", "date": "31 December 2015", "body": "China's insurance regulators are raising alarms about risks in the industry, warning that aggressive stock buying by insurers and sales of high-return products could damage the country's financial system. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission has issued at least six statements on risk control since late November, including a demand for better disclosure and limits on the size of high-return products. As the economy enters the new normal, cross-market financial contagion risks cannot be neglected, the regulators said in a warning to the industry dated Dec. 11. The Chinese insurance industry is dominated by several huge players, operating alongside dozens of smaller, more aggressive companies. Analysts say Beijing is most concerned about the smaller companies, which are pitching investment products, with promised annual returns as high as 8%, to savers who are frustrated with China's volatile stock market and with low interest rates offered by bank savings accounts. China has cut interest rates six times since November last year, dropping deposit rates to 1.5% from 3%. The regulators appear to have two main concerns. They worry that insurers, which need to boost their own returns to meet the promised high payouts, have been scooping up stocks, helping to drive the market to a one-month high and adding volatility. They also are uneasy about the products themselves, and the risk of a mismatch between the insurers' investments and their promised payouts. The massive buying by some insurance firms is upsetting because they violated the principle of sound investment, said an editorial in Tuesday's print edition of the official People's Daily, a mouthpiece of China's Communist Party. Beijing has frequently raised concerns about financial stability this year, as the stock market soared then crashed. Analysts say stock buying by insurers has helped boost China's battered stock market, which surged in the first half of the year only to fall by more than 40% from its highs. The Shanghai Composite Index is up more than 20% from this year's low in late August, but a recent rally in some stocks has been seen as too much. The market rally in December was primarily driven by insurers' buying frenzy, says Shen Zhengyang, an equity analyst at Northeast Securities Inc. That's against the government's will to cultivate a slow bull. Chinese insurers have spent more than 130 billion yuan ($20 billion) to raise stakes to at least 5% in 26 listed companies in the second half of this year, according to calculation by the state-run Securities Daily. In China, firms must disclose their holdings after their stakes hit 5%. When word gets out that insurers are buying stocks, fast-trading individual investors often pile in, driving up the prices of shares. Under new rules announced this month, the regulator will require insurers to disclose big share-purchase plans and look to limit how many higher-return products insurers can sell. While pressure to deliver high returns is one reason why insurers have become more aggressive, rules changes by the government also have played a part. As it was trying to stabilize the crashing stock market in the second half of the year, Beijing allowed insurers to boost their investments in stocks to 40% of assets from a previous limit of 30% by investing the additional allocation in blue-chip stocks. Enhance International, a consultancy focused on insurance, estimates that U.S. life-insurance firms allocated only about 2.5% of their total assets to stocks and about 73% to bonds in 2014. That is much lower than the 14% overall allocation to stocks that Chinese insurers already have, analysts say. One product that has garnered investor attention is universal life insurance, which promises 6% returns on average. In February, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission lifted the 2.5% cap on minimum guaranteed returns for such products, allowing insurers to set their own interest rates. The regulator estimates that premium income from this type of insurance reached more than 600 billion yuan in the first 10 months of 2015 -- 29% of the industry's total income from premiums, and nearly double the premiums of 2014. A Dec. 9 statement by the regulator said insurers should stop selling high cash value products if they already are failing to meet minimum capital requirements. For these products, which include universal life policies, Chinese insurers pay beneficiaries a large cash return for their investment, and only a small token death benefit. The regulator also said insurers shouldn't be receiving premiums for these products valued at more than twice the amount of a company's investment capital, effectively putting a brake on how aggressive smaller insurers can be. Recently insurers have gone beyond just buying stocks and appear to be interested in buying big stakes or even whole companies, which also is worrying regulators. The most recent deal to raise concerns came Monday, when PICC Property & Casualty Co., a unit of state-owned People's Insurance Co. of China, agreed to buy Deutsche Bank AG's nearly 20% stake in China's Hua Xia Bank Co. for up to 25.7 billion yuan. PICC P&C couldn't immediately be reached for comment by phone. The most controversial move by an insurer this year has been the possible takeover attempt on the world's largest property developer by sales, China Vanke Co., by Baoneng Group, a property-to-insurance conglomerate that owns Foresea Life Insurance Co. Baoneng has bought roughly a quarter of the shares of Vanke, which has a market value of $40.5 billion, though it hasn't made a formal offer. Baoneng couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Vanke has stepped up efforts to rebuff any offer, saying Tuesday it had reached a deal to potentially issue new shares to an unidentified investor. -- Yifan Xie and Chao Deng License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "World News: The Year Ahead Points To Stronger, Bolder  China", "date": "31 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING -- China's efforts to project its economic and military clout around the world are set to accelerate as the country fleshes out plans for new trade routes between Europe and Asia in 2016 and tries to consolidate its grasp over disputed islands in the South China Sea. With Beijing holding the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 nations next year, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to press ahead with his drive to challenge U.S. dominance of the global financial and security order. That threatens to put Beijing increasingly at odds with Washington, although U.S. President Barack Obama, preoccupied by Russia and the Mideast, is expected to avoid a major confrontation with China in his final year in office. One potential flashpoint is the South China Sea, where U.S. officials have said American navy ships and planes will continue to patrol -- roughly twice every quarter -- near artificial islands China has built in the past two years. Since the U.S. resumed those patrols in October, China has repeatedly denounced them as violations of its sovereignty and warned it will take all necessary countermeasures, but it hasn't tried to physically block or expel U.S. vessels. Its capacity to patrol the area will be enhanced when it finishes much of its construction of airfields, radar stations and other facilities on the artificial islands. The islands aren't growing out any more: They're now growing up, Gregory Poling, an expert on Asian maritime security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a recent podcast. By which I mean China's focused on building all the infrastructure -- the buildings, the ports -- that are going to be needed to make these functioning bases, he said. The potential for miscalculation is great: An American B-52 bomber, flying through bad weather, unintentionally strayed within 2 nautical miles of one of China's artificial islands, U.S. officials said in December. Another point of contention has been a court case brought by the Philippines -- a U.S. ally -- over China's expansive claims in the South China Sea. The international tribunal in The Hague is scheduled to make a final decision around June. Tensions over Taiwan, an old irritant to China-U.S. ties, risk flaring up again with the anticipated victory of an independence-leaning candidate in a presidential election in January. Beijing sees the island as a renegade province but Washington is obliged by U.S. law to help defend it. Cybersecurity attacks, a more recent strain in relations, were tackled in 2015 with a new dialogue mechanism agreed upon in September. The coming year will test how quickly Beijing carries out investigations of past attacks, and how well the mechanism manages allegations of fresh attacks. U.S. officials say sanctions remain an option. Both China and the U.S. have sought to play down tensions over the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or AIIB, which Beijing established in 2015 as a counterpart to the U.S.-dominated World Bank and Japan-dominated Asian Development Bank. The AIIB is due to dispense its first loans in 2016, providing the first indications of whether it will complement existing institutions, as Beijing says, or undermine international governance standards, as Washington fears. Beijing is also expected to unveil several new infrastructure projects as part of its much-vaunted One Belt, One Road program to build new trade and transport links between Asia and Europe. While Washington has welcomed Beijing's plans to finance infrastructure in the developing world, U.S. officials remain wary of China's strategic goals and are monitoring its efforts to secure staging points for its military overseas. One potential area of friction in the coming year is the East African nation of Djibouti, where the U.S. has a large military base and where China confirmed in November that it was seeking to build its first overseas military outpost. China's military activities will come under particular scrutiny in the U.S. when it sends naval ships to join U.S.-led Rimpac naval exercises off Hawaii in June and July. The first time China joined the biennial drills, in 2014, it sent an uninvited spy ship to monitor them from international waters. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

Treasurys ticked higher as falling oil prices sapped investor demand for riskier assets, and the dollar inched up against the yen. Gold prices dipped, weighed down by the stronger dollar and falling oil. OPENING CALL As the year draws to a close, gold prices are down nearly 11%. Some market participants believe the metal's weakness will persist into 2016. \u0093Oil will likely resume its downward trajectory in the new year and the odds are for continued strength in the dollar. Until those forces stabilize, the metals have not posted their lows, said Peter Hug, global trading director at Kitco Metals, in a note to clients. EQUITIES A decline in oil prices rippled through markets Wednesday, triggering losses in energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 117.11 points, or 0.7%, to 17603.87. The S&P 500 fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8%. Energy stocks led declines in the S&P 500, falling 1.5%. Trading volumes have been light this week. Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan will be closed Friday for the New Year's holiday. Wednesday's action comes amid a lackluster month, and year, for stocks. The S&P 500 has fallen 0.8% so far in December, and has gained 0.2% for the year. The index's 2015 advance is on track to be its smallest since 2011, when it ended little changed. \u0093Start to the finish, you just ended up where you started, unless you include dividends, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. \u0093But in between it certainly was a wild ride, he added. That includes a bout of volatility in the summer, when fears about a slowdown in Chinese growth prompted the first correction in major U.S. indexes since 2011. Signs of weakness in oil prices have kept investors cautious in recent sessions, said Brenda Kelly, head analyst at London Capital Group. Lower commodity prices should be positive for growth and consumer spending, but the fall may not simply reflect an excess supply of oil, said Ms. Kelly. \u0093If it's a sign of a lack of demand or slowing growth, then you've got problems, she said. U.S. crude prices have declined 31% this year. Stocks of oil and gas companies have tumbled in tandem, dragging the S&P 500's energy sector down 24% in 2015. Ken Winans, president of Winans Investments, said he sold his energy stocks over a year ago and hasn't dipped back into the sector yet as oil prices continue to decline. \u0093At this point, you've got to be a bit of a commodity trader to want to step into the oil stocks, he said. \u0093People have tried to bottom pick these things all year long and have just gotten creamed, he added. In corporate news, Bank of America shares fell 1.3%. The bank said late Tuesday it expects to post a pretax write-down of roughly $600 million in the fourth quarter related to the redemption of $2 billion of trust preferred securities. Billionaire Carl Icahn won a bidding war for Pep Boys -Manny, Moe & Jack, striking a deal to buy the auto parts and repair chain for about $1 billion. Shares in Pep Boys fell 2.9%. In Asian trading Wednesday, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 stock index rose 1% in its ninth straight session of gains and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average edged up 0.3%, gaining for a third consecutive session. The Shanghai Composite added 0.3%, and is on track to rise 10.5% this year, despite losing more than 40% of its value over the summer. FOREX The currencies of commodity-exporting countries weakened as oil prices declined on oversupply concerns. Currencies such as the Brazilian real, the Norwegian krone and the Russian ruble all depreciated a day after Saudi Arabia signaled it would maintain its high levels of oil production and weekly numbers showed that U.S. crude supplies rose. A global oil glut has dragged crude prices lower for more than a year, which has weighed on the currencies of oil exporters. In addition, large price swings heading into year-end have hurt currencies that investors regard as risky, such as those in emerging markets, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. This likely will be a theme for 2016, he added. \u0093We have a weaker commodity backdrop here that's weighing on the real, Mr. Esiner said. \u0093Commodity currencies were stung again overnight by another hefty selloff in crude oil. A nearly 3% fall in oil overnight erased all of the previous session's gains and kept this group, whose economies depend on revenue from the sale of oil and commodities, broadly pressured. In other trade, the dollar fell 0.1% against the euro, and the U.S. currency inched up 0.1% against the yen. BONDS U.S. government bonds eked out some price gains as lower oil prices cut investors' appetites for riskier investments. Some fund managers also scooped up Treasury debt as part of their month-end portfolio adjustments after a $29 billion sale of seven-year notes. The auction wrapped up new U.S. Treasury debt supply in 2015. On the last trading session of each month, newly minted bonds replace maturing debt in many bond indexes. Fund managers who track the indexes typically replicate the changes by buying bonds, focusing on longer-term maturities. Because the U.S. bond market will close Thursday at 2 p.m. EST, and trading is thinner than normal leading into the end of the year, some decided to tweak their portfolios Wednesday afternoon. Taken together, the factors helped the bond market reverse an earlier round of price declines as bond dealers and investors pushed up yields earlier to prepare for the auction. Many investors have closed their trades for 2015 and are waiting for early January to implement their investment strategies. Traders caution that these factors may exaggerate price moves in financial markets. The bond market will remain shut Friday for New Year's Day following Thursday's shortened session. COMMODITIES Oil prices tumbled after data showed an unexpected increase in U.S. crude supplies. Diesel futures dropped to the lowest level since 2004 as U.S. stockpiles of distillates, a category that includes diesel fuel and heating oil, rose more than expected. A global glut of crude has weighed on the market for more than a year. Oil prices are on course to fall by more than a third this year as big suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia have continued pumping crude in a bid to defend their market share. Meanwhile, U.S. crude output has been resilient despite the low prices, and much of the excess has gone into storage. U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.6 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 25, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Analysts had expected a decline of 1 million barrels. The unexpected increase was due to higher imports and an uptick in production. The EIA reported that U.S. crude production rose by 23,000 barrels a day last week to 9.2 million barrels a day. While U.S. output is down from a peak in April, production has fallen more slowly in response to low prices than many investors initially expected. Companies have been able to cut costs and increase efficiency, keeping output high in a low-price environment. \u0093Production is up again, it's defying all odds, said Dominick Chirichella, analyst at the Energy Management Institute. \u0093We still just have a robust amount of supply. [...] I just don't see anything that excites me to want to buy the market. Also on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said that the country's policy of unrestrained output \u0093is a reliable policy and we won't change it. Saudi Arabia has cut its production during past price downturns to force prices higher. Saudi Arabia pumped 10.13 million barrels a day in November, down from record levels over the summer, but up from 9.584 million barrels in November last year, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In other commodity markets, gold prices dipped Wednesday, pushed down by a stronger dollar and falling oil prices.

{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "30 December 2015", "body": "Corrections & Amplifications American International Group entities own a 18.5% stake in PICC Property & Casualty's Hong Kong shares, or 5.7% of its total share capital including nontraded shares in mainland China. A Heard on the Street item Wednesday incorrectly characterized its stake in the Hong Kong shares as an overall stake. (WSJE December 31, 2015) (END) Banking's Shaky Shock Absorber Telling banks to raise more capital as financial risks build up sounds eminently sensible. The U.K. will start doing this soon, joining Brazil, the U.S., Sweden and Norway among others. But the actual effects of the so-called countercyclical buffer look tiny. Plus, it is a blunt instrument that hits all banks equally and will replace a more tailored approach to capital that can better reflect the real risks run and created by individual banks. The argument for this buffer is that it will be more transparent and that it should make banks more resilient when lending is becoming too free. However, for less aggressive lenders it might just devalue their prudence, while it also might not stop a credit crunch, which appears to be its main purpose. The idea of the countercyclical buffer is to lift it slowly but surely as a credit party gets going. It can then be hacked back sharply when reality hits and lending typically contracts. But it isn't meant to control the credit cycle -- the Bank of England says that will be done through interest rates and so-called macroprudential policies that can explicitly restrict certain kinds of lending. The point of this buffer lies more in the regulator's ability to cut it when the credit cycle turns and losses start to bite. If the regulator suddenly says banks don't need the buffer it means they can suffer more losses without breaching capital requirements. The idea is they are then less likely to stop lending suddenly. At its peak, a buffer of 3.5% of U.K. risk-weighted assets would add only about 1.4 percentage points to total core equity capital requirements across all banks in the U.K. on average -- although it would obviously weigh more on a U.K.-focused lender like Lloyds Banking Group than on, say, HSBC. But in money terms that means at its largest the buffer will add an extra roughly GBP 35 billion ($52.07 billion) to total group-wide equity of about GBP 300 billion for all banks in the U.K. This sounds like a nice shock absorber. But for individual banks that have been most aggressive, it might not be enough to stop them retrenching when the cycle turns. Meanwhile, for the more prudent it will just be a drain on returns and so could devalue the point of being more cautious than rivals. The alternative, tailored capital add-ons, might be less transparent, but they can be cut to fit a bank's business model and reflect how well it is managed. That would seem more likely to stop badly run and aggressive lenders from causing trouble for themselves and everyone else. -- Paul J. Davies There Is Value Hidden in Chinese Insurer PICC Group The staid world of insurance has thrown up an interesting value play. The actors include two of China's top insurers and one of America's. State-run People's Insurance Co. (Group) of China, or PICC Group, is the country's oldest national insurance company. Since listing in Hong Kong in 2012, its shares have been mostly flat. Its market value is $21.2 billion. PICC runs separate insurance operations in property and casualty, life and health. The property-and-casualty arm is the biggest and is separately listed in Hong Kong as PICC Property & Casualty. Performing much better than its parent, PICC P&C boasts a market capitalization of $30.3 billion. Considering PICC Group owns 69% of PICC P&C, the value of this stake within the bigger insurance group itself comes to $20.9 billion -- barely less than PICC Group's total market capitalization. That implies that the equity value of PICC Group's non-P&C businesses is slightly north of zero. It was actually negative for most of the past three months. Clearly, PICC's non-P&C businesses invite pessimism. Their implied value has been falling since 2012, because PICC's scale in life and health is small, and health has racked up losses. Yet investors have rarely thought these businesses are worth so little. To think so now is too harsh. PICC Group's life arm grew premiums by 15.7%, year over year, during the first half of 2015. Health premiums fell, but market share rose while the segment eked out its first profit since 2011. These businesses could also benefit from overhauled product distribution and, in one case, new management, according to UBS. Rawen Huang, founder of hedge fund Petrel Capital, says the life and health arms should at least be worth their embedded value, a metric that calculates net assets plus the present value of future profits. That makes them worth $7.4 billion to PICC Group, in proportion of its ownership. It makes sense to specifically invest in PICC's life and health arms by buying PICC Group shares and selling short PICC P&C. This has the benefit of leaving investors agnostic to what occurs at PICC P&C, such as its acquisition Monday of Deutsche Bank's stake in Hua Xia Bank, a midsize Chinese lender, for about $4 billion. If the broader market doesn't correct the valuation discrepancy on its own, American International Group, a key shareholder in both companies, could. AIG has cut its holding in PICC P&C twice this year. It could sell further, given that its entities still own a significant 18.5% stake in P&C. It hasn't sold its PICC Group holding. At 1.9 times book value, PICC P&C is more expensive than the parent's 1.2 times. Selling the P&C unit and holding the parent would be shrewd, both for ordinary investors and for AIG. -- Abheek Bhattacharya Covestro IPO Makes Its Strides This child has happily toddled free of its parent. Shares in Covestro, the materials business spun off of Germany's Bayer, are up nearly 30% since its October listing while its erstwhile parent's stock is about flat. There is an element of good timing here. Covestro had to cut the number and price of shares sold in its listing amid investor concerns about Chinese demand. Shares in chemical-sector peers like BASF had fallen, spooked partly by heightened volatility in China's stock market this summer. As it became clearer that was a market dislocation, the shares rallied -- and took Covestro with them. The next test will be February's results and guidance for 2016. In polyurethanes, the rigid and flexible foams used in everything from furniture to cars and Covestro's largest business by sales, overcapacity is a problem, particularly in Asia. The fundamentals are better in polycarbonates, the strong plastics used in the automotive and electronics industries. Demand is helped by substitution designed to produce lighter products. Covestro has other advantages. Its capital expenditure is falling, boosting cash flows. And its specialty coating and ingredients business, its smallest by sales but a third of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a stable, high-margin unit. Covestro doesn't look expensive against bigger commodity-chemicals peers and its coatings business deserves a premium. That could help Covestro keep on its feet next year. -- Helen Thomas Overheard Tesla Motors may be switching to a higher gear. At least one analyst thinks Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries, likely to be announced next week, will be a positive. Trip Chowdhry at Global Equities Research said Tuesday that Tesla has likely delivered more than 18,300 cars since Sept. 30. That would be above the midpoint of Tesla's guidance, which called for 17,000 to 19,000 deliveries. And it would be significantly higher than delivery totals in the past three quarters. This raises a risk that extra deliveries could cause the average vehicle selling price to fall, although Mr. Chowdhry believes this was stable in the fourth quarter. What remains to be seen is whether improved sales will translate to better cash flow. Tesla posted free cash flow of negative $1.7 billion in 2015's first nine months. And cash burn has worsened as the pace of deliveries quickened. Sometimes going faster doesn't get you where you need to be. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

The company said Tuesday that two Chinese smartphone makers, Beijing Tianyu Communication Equipment Co. and Haier Group, agreed to pay royalties under patent licenses that allow them to manufacture mobile devices using 3G and 4G wireless technologies.

Financial terms weren't disclosed, but Qualcomm said the three deals were consistent with the licensing terms set under a settlement in February with China's antitrust agency. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, derives most of its revenue from selling chips that handle wireless communications and calculating chores in smartphones. But a bigger share of profits comes from licensing patents on wireless inventions. The company's licensing practices have prompted a series of government investigations, including probes by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and agencies in South Korea and Taiwan. European authorities are investigating issues related to chip sales. The company has said it is cooperating with the investigations and believes it is acting legally. -- Don Clark and Anne Steele License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

Crowley president and chief executive effective Jan. 4, ending an extensive search by the aerospace parts supplier for a permanent CEO. Triumph, a supplier for aerospace giants such as Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp.'s Gulfstream business, said Mr. Crowley has spent 32 years in the aerospace and defense industry, most recently as president of two Raytheon Co. units. Mr. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, who was CEO from 1993 to 2012 and left retirement in April to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned. The Berwyn, Pa., company's board formed a committee and hired an executive-recruiting firm to assist in the search for a successor. Mr. Ill, who founded Triumph, will remain a member of the board. Chairman Ralph E.

European authorities are investigating issues related to chip sales. The company has said it is cooperating with the investigations and believes it is acting legally. The China settlement, which followed an investigation that stretched for 18 months, had been expected to trigger a stream of licensing agreements with Chinese handset makers. But Qualcomm in early November cited continuing delays in reaching licensing deals in China when it reported a 44% drop in profit in the fiscal fourth quarter and issued disappointing earnings guidance for the year. Those disclosures sent Qualcomm's shares down 15% in a single trading session. The stock remains off more than 30% for 2015, despite a 3% rise Tuesday and subsequent signs of progress in China. Earlier this month, for example, Qualcomm reached a patent-licensing deal with Xiaomi Corp., one of China's largest smartphone makers. The company had previously disclosed deals with China's Huawei Technologies Co., TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd. and ZTE Corp. Qualcomm has also been in talks with Lenovo Group Ltd., people familiar with the matter have said, but no deal has been announced. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's chief executive, said on Dec. 15 that the company was \u0093actively engaged in negotiations with all remaining major Chinese handset makers. \u0093And although the timing is uncertain, we remain confident we will conclude additional agreements over time, he said. Those comments followed Qualcomm's decision not to split the company's chip business from its patent licensing business after a lengthy study prompted by pressure for change from an activist investor. Despite recent signs of licensing progress, some analysts have continued to publish bearish reports on the company, predicting that its royalty rates likely will decline over time. Meanwhile, the company's market share in mobile chips faces growing competition from companies such as MediaTek Inc., a unit of Huawei, and the internal design operations of smartphone makers Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Will Strauss, an analyst with market research firm Forward Concepts, said MediaTek is selling chips \u0093like gangbusters in China, but he is becoming more optimistic about Qualcomm's financial position following the recent licensing deals. \u0093They are finally getting that straightened out, he said.

{"title": "Economy", "date": "30 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Banking watchdog releases draft regulations to rein in booming sector of internet financing 'middlemen' that is becoming increasingly problematic The mainland has taken its first concrete step towards reining in its boisterous online lending industry, which has grown increasingly problematic and threatens to endanger financial stability. In draft rules issued this week, the China Banking Regulatory Commission defined such businesses as internet financing intermediaries that operate between borrowers and lenders, which means they cannot raise or lend funds on their own. The commission acknowledged that an absence of risk controls and supervision, together with a shortage of rules, had allowed some firms to illegally raise funds and flee when the risks were exposed. The regulator said 2,612 peer-to-peer (P2P) online lending firms were operating normally by the end of last month, while more than 1,000 additional lenders were considered problematic, accounting for 30 per cent of the total. The draft came after Fanya Metals Exchange failed with 36 billion yuan (HK$43 billion) owed to investors. It also came after an investigation into the financing model of Ezubao, which raised 75 billion yuan from more than 900,000 \u00adinvestors. The commission's draft regulation, issued on Monday, forbids P2P online lending firms from selling wealth management products, insurances and trust products, which often promise high \u00adreturns. It also bans such firms from guaranteeing yields as well as from pooling their investors' money. In another move to shore up financial stability, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, announced yesterday that it would improve management of deposit reserves and credit creation from 2016, expanding its supervision to cover more bank assets and including more parameters in its deposit reserves policy. Observers say the move will give the central bank a bigger role in financial supervision. Zeng Gang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the draft rules would have a significant impact on the sector as many players would be knocked out once the restrictions took effect. The deadline for public feedback is January 27, and the industry will be given a grace period of 18 months to comply. The draft rules, which take a negative-list approach to laying out the restrictions, will provide more room for qualified P2P online lending platforms to grow their business, said Wei Wei, co-founder of Jimubox, one of the mainland's leading P2P lending platforms. Some of those failed platforms have hurt investors' confidence and the industry's reputation. Internet financing has seen explosive growth over the past two years, with big listed firms, private business and state-owned financial institutions actively developing their own P2P platforms. Lufax, a P2P lending unit operated by Ping An Insurance, predicts the internet finance sector will reach US$565 billion by 2018 - nine times bigger than the estimated scale in the United States by that year. Northeast Securities said in a research report that at the end of the first half of 2015, nearly 70 per cent of internet users had used products and services provided by the online finance sector. More than 60 per cent of customers conducted monthly investments in the sector, it said. But there have been widespread concerns of a regulatory vacuum. The draft lists multiple departments as responsible for supervision, including the commission, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, as well as the internet information watchdog and local finance regulatory departments. But concerns remain that the arrangement will still prove inadequate. "}
{"title": "China  Moves To Cool Off Web  Finance  --- Sector, which may portend how rest of the world will pay for things, is hit by abuses", "date": "29 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING -- China is putting tighter regulations on its fast-growing online finance sector, where an explosion of new options for payments and loans is offering a glimpse of how the rest of the world may someday handle money. Chinese Internet companies have transformed the average smartphone into a platform for cashless transactions, bank transfers, loans and investments far beyond what is common in the U.S. With many skipping credit cards entirely, Chinese people buy money-market funds, split a restaurant check and pay for services ranging from taxis to takeout food all within the same phone app. Last year, nearly a quarter of China's population -- a number bigger than the total U.S. population -- made payments online. Data provider Euromonitor International estimates that China's mobile payments this year will total $213 billion, compared with $163.5 billion for the U.S. The biggest payment service, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. called Alipay, has 400 million users. These numbers are phenomenal when compared to other payment providers that operate globally, said Ng Zhi Ying of Forrester Research Inc. Internet companies are pushing to allow users to open online-only bank accounts on their smartphones, with their identities confirmed via selfies. Meanwhile, China's peer-to-peer, or P2P, lenders, which connect investors with borrowers through online networks, are set to make $33.2 billion in loans this year, 43% more than in the U.S., and could see issuance triple over the next two years, according to Morgan Stanley projections. Now, Chinese regulators have moved to lay down some ground rules. On Monday, they issued guidelines limiting what payment platforms can do and proposed draft interim rules on the P2P lending industry, where explosive growth has been tainted by cases of alleged fraud. The opportunities and the risks of Internet finance are proportional, which means they are both immense, said Joe Ngai, director and managing partner of McKinsey & Co.'s Hong Kong office. Regulators also have resisted approving technology, such as facial recognition, for opening full-service online bank accounts without the need for physical outlets or automated teller machines. The People's Bank of China's said Friday that China doesn't have basic standards for biometric technology and no national or industrial standards for its use in the financial sector. Therefore, the conditions are not yet mature for using biometric technology as the primary means of verifying the identities of depositors, the central bank said. In China, you see a lot of stuff happening for the first time over the mobile and Internet platforms, said Tim Pagett, financial-services industry leader at Deloitte China, adding that Chinese consumers soon may buy cars and insurance via their phones. In terms of how widely Internet finance is used, he said, China is far ahead of the rest of the world. Internet finance is touching parts of China's economy -- everybody from students to farmers to truck drivers -- long denied credit in China's state-run banking system. In the port city of Tianjin, long-haul trucker Shi Junze fell on tough times two years ago when transportation fees dropped and clients delayed payments. We were at a point where we basically could no longer maintain our trucks, Mr. Shi said. And banks wouldn't give loans to ordinary people like us. Fincera Inc., an online truck-financing service supported by a P2P lending platform, gave him 30,000 yuan ($4,600) in monthly credit for repairs, maintenance and gasoline. Slowly, we were able to make our payments and finally got through that difficult time, he said. With that extra income, Mr. Shi's family started a small business this year selling trucks. Internet finance in China has skyrocketed largely because traditional banks haven't provided many individuals with access to investment vehicles and other ways to increase their money. Banks have stuck to lending primarily to state-owned enterprises because they have implicit or explicit government backing for debt repayment, which makes them seem more secure. China's banks have vowed to compete. Until now, regulators have stayed on the sidelines, aware that these offerings can help promote the government's goals of boosting domestic consumption and entrepreneurship. China is a big gray area, said Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive officer at the boutique investment bank China Renaissance, which has done deals involving Internet finance companies. You can be very creative, do whatever you want. Chinese Internet giants including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group are taking the next step by opening Internet-only banks. Traditional banks are only for savings, said Hu Yu, a 24-year-old entrepreneur in the city of Hangzhou. Mr. Hu said he used an online bank backed by Tencent to invest 40,000 yuan in a money-market fund offering an 8% annual interest rate, a much higher rate than bank deposits. The Internet giants have proposed allowing prospective customers to open new accounts through facial-recognition software using their smartphone cameras. Such technology would allow users to open regular bank accounts remotely and for the banks to receive deposits. While bank regulators haven't approved it, industry players say discussions with the companies continue. I can understand that regulators are very cautious, said Jason Lu, who is in charge of fraud risk management at Ant Financial Services Group. This is a very, very important milestone, we are pushing technology into financial services, which is the most heavily secure, sensitive area. In P2P lending, dozens of platforms shut every month, with operators running away with funds put in by investors. In September, authorities in Guangdong province solved a P2P fraud case in which more than 90 people in Guangdong, Shanghai and nine other provinces and cities had been cheated of more than 10 million yuan. Officials said three suspects were arrested. This month, Beijing police said they were investigating Chinese P2P lender Ezubo and associated companies for alleged illegal operations, without giving details. Ezubo's site has been taken down, and its executives couldn't be reached for comment. As of Dec. 8, it had 74.57 billion yuan in loan volume and 909,500 total investors, according to Chinese P2P industry tracking firm Wangdaizhijia. In online payments, the central bank's new rules require companies to take more steps to verify the identities of their users and limit the amount of funds that can be transferred between accounts. The proposed interim rules on such services released Monday for public comment state that P2P platforms must entrust their users' funds to the custody of brick-and-mortar banks -- a move aimed at protecting investors. But industry players and experts say most banks aren't ready to serve Internet-based lending, which has mostly worked through online payment platforms. --- Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this article.

{"title": "Business", "date": "29 December 2015", "body": "The jury is still out on the actual causes of the market turmoil that started in June, but a clampdown on official and unofficial channels of credit coincided with the U-turn in China shares. Throughout the first half of the year, mainland authorities, concerned about irrational exuberance in China stocks, unveiled a successive tightening of rules that enable investors to use borrowed money to buy securities. The process began in early January, when the China Securities Regulatory Commission, increased the minimum threshold for margin trading accounts to 500,000 yuan (HK$597,000) from zero. In spite of these efforts, China's margin-financing balance ballooned to 2.27 trillion yuan as of June 16, more that double what it was at the start of the year. Around the same time, the Shanghai Composite reached its highest level in seven years. It's not clear what administrative measure tipped the balance, but at some point investors rapidly cut back their leveraged bets, triggering a panic sell-off and leading to a months-long free fall in mainland markets. \u0093The growth in margin businesses is not unlimited, as markets tend to become unstable once the margin-financing balance exceeds its reasonable limits, such as 3.5 per cent of free-float market cap,\u0094 said Jupiter Zheng, an analyst from Hong Kong-based BOCOM International. \u0093The market crash since June is largely due to a rapid deleveraging of the markets, through both official and unofficial channels,\u0094 he added. As the Shanghai benchmark tumbled 40 per cent from its June peak within two months, the margin-financing balance also shrank rapidly. The outstanding balance of margin loans and short-selling bottomed at 904 billion yuan as of September 30, or about 60 per cent below its level in June. The imploding stock market prompted Beijing to roll out unprecedented rescue measures, including limits on short selling, setting up an emergency funds to purchase stocks and banning major stock holders from selling shares. As of December 23, the Shanghai Composite Index was up 20 per cent in the fourth quarter. Coinciding with this rise is a gradual recovery in the margin-financing balance, which now stands about equal to its level in February. The current daily margin buying amount accounts for 10 per cent of the average daily market turnover, according to calculations by Deutsche Bank in a December 21 research note. Still, its likely that new controls will help to foster a more gradual rate of growth in margin financing in the year ahead. In November, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced they will cut by half the amount that retail investors can borrow to purchase stocks, in a move to rein in speculative trading and prevent systemic risks. The new rules indicated that Beijing has \u0093learnt lessons from the market correction in June\u0094 and hope to contain risks from margin businesses, J.P. Morgan analysts said in a recent research note. Xu Fei, an analyst for Sinolink Securities, said the policy is mainly aimed at \u0093adjusting the pace of the markets and prompting a slow and long bull.\u0094 BOCOM's Zheng agrees that authorities are likely seeking to foster an alternative path for China's markets. \u0093The authorities don't want to kill a market rally, but they hope to see a healthy stock market with reasonable leverage, rather than a rapid increase in margin lending which may exacerbate the short-term volatility and pose systemic risks to the financing system,\u0094 Zheng said. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse analysts also expected the market liquidity to remain positive in 2016. The margin-lending business may benefit from newly-added \u0093qualified investors\u0094 and the regulator's crackdown on illegal OTC (over-the-counter) fund-matching, Charles Zhou and Arjan van Veen, analysts from the Swiss firm, said in a 2016 outlook research note. China has recently relaxed its control on foreign investors seeking to invest in the country's capital markets. Earlier this month the foreign exchange watchdog loosened the rules on the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors scheme, making it easier for foreign investors to transfer funds between selected investment products.

{"title": "Business", "date": "29 December 2015", "body": "Specifically, this hinges on a universal algorithm created by a team of research biologists from China and Japan which they claim can detect tipping points and predict disasters ranging from financial market crashes to possible regime change. Their findings were based on experiments conducted on lab rats exposed to toxic gases. In their paper published recently in the journalScientific Reports, the team demonstrated how the financial mayhem that stemmed from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and other such momentous changes, could be forecast in the same way and with as much accuracy as the time of death of a mouse exposed to a poisonous gas. The algorithm detected mathematically identical signals hours before the death of the mouse and before the collapse of the US financial services firm. It was intended to break the barrier between financial analysis and biological science by developing a one-size-fits-all way of forecasting negative events in multiple fields, the team said. It could potentially \u0093detect regime shifts or the collapse of an economic, climatic or biological system, or the collapse of a financial market,\u0094 the authors wrote. It can also be applied to any pre-existing way of forecasting events of magnitude to make the results more accurate, the team said. ?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=intranet&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign Most complex systems hit a point known as \u0093critical slowing down\u0094. This could be a noticeable drop in an animal's blood oxygen level just before it dies, or the sudden decline of a company's stock price just before the firm declares bankruptcy. However, these momentous events are usually hard to detect because of various forms of \u0093noise\u0094 or interference, for example new government policies or even a civil war. Many models have been developed to forecast future trends by detecting so-called tipping points, but the latest method represents an important step forward as it can see its way past all the noise - something economists and mathematicians have previously not been able to do. The research team was led by Professor Chen Luonan at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences and Professor Kazuyuki Aihara at the University of Tokyo. They followed a similar methodology to the one that Einstein - who introduced time as a fourth dimension - used in the world of physics to throw light on a number of unsolved puzzles. Now physicists keep adding more dimensions to try and explain the secrets of the universe. Inspired by this and the world of biological science, Chen and his colleagues created an algorithm that can increase the number of \u0093dimensions\u0094 of a forecasting model. They found that the more dimensions a model had, the more effectively it could reduce major forms of interference and detect critical changes that lie ahead. But Yang Jingping, a professor of financial mathematics at Peking University, said it was unrealistic to compare investors in financial markets to mice in a gas chamber in a controlled experiment. While the mice were unable to escape, the investors could adjust their portfolios at will, said Yang, who was not involved in the research. If the new algorithm worked, investors would use it to avoid risk, which would alter the outcome of events in the real world, he added. For example, if a majority of investors listened to a report issued on a Monday suggesting that a listed company would go bankrupt that Friday, they would likely offload their stock and probably cause the company to go under even sooner, thus making the original forecast inaccurate.

{"title": "nws focus 01.pgl", "date": "29 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Over the course of three decades, real estate tycoon Wang Shi has sought to portray himself in the media as an idealistic, self-made entrepreneur. After forming China Vanke, now China's biggest home builder in 1984, he gave up his share ownership when the company went public in 1991, later choosing to become a professional manager. While the business boomed, he handed actual power to another man, the company's president Yu Liang, and became board chairman. Already in his 60s, he led a young person's lifestyle - climbing mountains, rowing and studying. Most controversially, he also started dating an actress 30 years his junior. The most often repeated part of the media hagiographies was that he never bribed officials. His company also refrained from hoarding land or bidding up prices, common practises in the industry, Wang claimed in many public speeches and interviews. He made his first bucket of gold trading corn from northeastern China to Shenzhen in the 1980s, the story went, neglecting to mention he was also the son-in-law of a senior provincial party official. This month's takeover attempt by Baoneng Group is not the first time Wang's seat of power at Vanke has come under threat.The wealth I created didn't belong to me. In other words, I was only managing money for the country and the peopleWang Shi In 1994, several of Vanke's major shareholders led by Junan Securities, which merged with Guotai Securities to form what is now Guotai Junan Securities in 1999, launched a fight for control by issuing a letter to all shareholders, suggesting a restructuring of Vanke's business and management team. Junan said Vanke's business structure, which then covered a wide range of areas, decentralised the company's resources and distracted the management's focus. It urged Vanke to restructure its business and management, and recommended eight to 10 directors to the then 14-member board. Wang won the battle, after a three-day suspension of share trading, by talking the key members of the alliance out of the takeover attempt. He accused Junan of rat trading - collaborating with other parties to take advantage of a client by not executing orders at the best price - and submitted evidence to the securities regulatory commission, which launched an investigation and made Junan abandon the restructuring plan. In his book The Road and the Dream, Wang, now 64, said he was totally unaware back then that the barbarians had been waiting at Vanke's gate for a long time. Last week's support from Anbang Insurance Group eliminated the immediate possibility of Baoneng taking control of Vanke's board, but many say the hazard lingers. After saying Baoneng's Yao Zhenhua lacked credibility, Wang was widely accused of seeking to morally blackmail his rival. Yao's background was also publicly aired. Zeng Baobao, founder of Shenzhen-based financial holding group Fantasia, said 45-year-old Yao used to make a living by frying dough sticks, a popular Chinese snack known as youtiao. He was also reported to be a vegetable vendor, and much of the land he bought later for development was acquired as part of a government project to secure the supply of vegetables. An online post by the alumni community of South China University of Technology later fired back that Yao studied at the university between 1988 and 1992, and graduated with two bachelor degrees, one in industrial engineering and management and the other in food engineering. It highlighted Yao's diligence when studying, saying this explained his ability to build a comprehensive enterprise now covering almost every industry. Before establishing Baoneng, Yao's company was Xinbaokang Real Estate Development, which was established as Xinbaokang Vegetable in 1997. Vanke listed in Shenzhen in 1991 but was a company without an actual controller after Wang and his team sold their stake in 2000 to China Resources, the biggest shareholder before Baoneng's recent moves. China Resources never held more than 20 per cent of shares and nor did it intervene much in Vanke's operation, suggesting some sort of tacit understanding. Vanke started off as a trader of animal feed in 1984. Last year it notched up 215 billion yuan (HK$256.8 billion) in real estate sales, making it a major global player. It began investing overseas in 2013, and now has six real estate development projects in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York and San Francisco. In a speech at a forum in Nanjing last year, Wang said he became an engineer at the Guangzhou railway bureau in the early 1980s after graduating from university in 1977. He moved to Shenzhen in 1983, starting as an employee at a state-owned enterprise dealing in feed. In 1988, when Vanke was reformed as a joint-stock operation, Wang gave his stock to a charity fund, although be was believed to have retained ultimate ownership of most of them. One major reason he cited for establishing the charity fund was that he started his empire on the basis of a state-owned enterprise. I used to work for an SOE, he told a seminar earlier this year. The wealth I created didn't belong to me. I was only managing money for the country and the people. He added that it was risky to suddenly have such a large sum of money back then, a time when people hated inequality more than poverty. Someone who got rich overnight could be in danger, probably even be killed \u0085 and I didn't know what to do with so much money, he said. In the early days Vanke covered a wide range of businesses, from exports to retail, before starting to focus on real estate in 1993. What Wang did not mention was his well-off family background. He was married to the daughter of the then deputy Communist Party boss of Guangdong province, Wang Ning.READ MORE: Battle for control of China Vanke a sign of things to comeREAD MORE: Chinese insurers spark off buying spree in mainland property firms The connection lasted until a few years ago, when Wang divorced his wife of over 40 years and started dating the then 31-year-old actress Tian Pujun, after meeting her in an MBA class. In 1999 Wang resigned as general manager of Vanke. Many said his high-profile adventures and romance were one of the reasons he was on the verge of losing control of the company. "}
{"title": "companies", "date": "29 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Baoneng Group came out swinging yesterday in its bid for mainland property giant China Vanke, insisting that its funding strategy is sound and saying it will release more information about its hostile takeover. Baoneng, a Shenzhen-based property and insurance conglomerate, made headlines early this month when it became Vanke's biggest shareholder with more than 20 per cent of the company. The move triggered a war of words, with Vanke chairman Wang Shi saying he did not welcome Baoneng as the largest shareholder. Wang also said Baoneng lacked credibility and branded the bid a gambler's act. According to mainland media, Baoneng borrowed heavily to fund the takeover. Reports said Baoneng funded its Vanke share purchases by borrowing at a leverage ratio of 14.29 from China Zheshang Bank. But the Shanghai Securities News yesterday quoted the company as saying that it had always had a good credit record and never financed through high leveraging. It is Baoneng's strategy to control leveraging, maintain stable business operations and ensure risks are controllable, a Baoneng official was quoted as saying. It was the first time since it launched the bid that Baoneng had replied publicly to concerns about its funding sources. Wang and Vanke's management had appealed to other shareholders and new investors to help stop Baoneng from becoming the biggest shareholder. Wang has won support from Anbang Insurance, which has about 7 per cent of Vanke. China Securities Regulatory Commission spokesman Zhang Xiaojun said last Friday that the CSRC was working with the banking and insurance watchdogs to review the Vanke deal to protect the interests of all shareholders. In a Hong Kong stock exchange filing late yesterday, Vanke's board said it was drafting a material asset restructuring proposal to raise the firm's value. > more stories A4 "}
{"title": "Markets", "date": "28 December 2015", "body": "Even if Chinese investors got burned in the selloff this year, the stock market, for many, still hasn't lost its appeal. The Shanghai Composite Index is on track to end the year as one of Asia's best-performing major benchmarks, up 9.3% as of Monday's close, despite losing as much as 43% of its value over the summer. That outpaces many other major global benchmarks, including a year-to-date gain of 0.1% in the S&P 500 and a 4.7% decline in London's FTSE 100. The Shanghai benchmark's smaller counterpart has recorded even more spectacular gains. The Shenzhen Composite Index has risen 63% this year while the ChiNext, composed of growth stocks and sometimes referred to as \u0093China's Nasdaq, is up 86%. By a number of metrics\u0097including trading volume, account openings and the amount of borrowed money used to invest\u0097Chinese investors remain committed to buying stocks, a turnaround from past crashes that sent investors fleeing and left the market languishing, at times for years. This time, Beijing's barrage of measures to rescue its cratering markets seemed to convince China's domestic investors that government support would continue, analysts say. \u0093When we asked people would they invest in stocks, the answer was yes, because the government is supporting the market, said Francis Cheung, head of China-Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Beijing's role in China's stock performance even preceded its massive rescue, which some analysts estimate cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The government drummed up support for stocks leading up to the market peak, which helped lift Shanghai 151% in the 12 months through June. When prices started sliding over the summer, Chinese authorities told government investors\u0097the so-called \u0093national team\u0097to buy. Hundreds of companies even voluntarily suspended trading of their shares rather than let them fall. To be sure, many of Beijing's measures to stop the selling also rattled investors, including steps to crimp any trading practices deemed overly risky, such as gray-market financing and short selling, the practice of using borrowed shares to bet that prices will fall. Authorities have arrested high-profile investors and brokerage heads to probe causes of the summer's stock crash. But for retail investors, who account for 85% of Chinese stock-market trading volume, confidence that government buying would continue convinced them to come back to the market and helped accelerate Shanghai's recovery. Mainland shares re-entered a bull market, defined as a rise of 20% from a recent low, in November. The recovery marks a contrast from the crash of October 2007, when the Shanghai Composite lost as much as 71% from peak to trough over the course of a year. That recovery took longer, too, with the benchmark rising as much as 96% by August 2009, and didn't recover previous highs. After the 2007 crash, market volumes fell by more than a third in the following six months and took two years to reach the same level of trading activity. Thereafter, trading volumes remained thin. In the six months from July to December this year, however, daily trading volumes fell on average by 11% compared with the prior six-month period, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The number of new trading accounts has also started to recover more quickly this year compared with the months after the 2007 crash. Investors opened about one 10th the number of new accounts in February 2008 as they did in October 2007, when the selloff started. While new account openings in Shanghai have fallen to 3.18 million in November from 8.78 million in June, the levels since the selloff still outstrip almost every month since the start of 2008. A practice unique to the latest rally was margin trading, the use of borrowed money to fuel stock purchases. Peaking at 2.2 trillion yuan ($339.5 billion) in June, margin lending amplified gains on the way up, but also accelerated losses as investors rushed to sell positions to repay their brokers. Authorities reined in brokers' lending during the summer, but since then, such borrowing has started to tick up again as investor confidence recovers. Retail investors' clutch over the market\u0097which has hovered around current levels since 2007\u0097can spark wild swings in trading. That is one reason why China's government has sought to lure more foreign institutional investors into its domestic equity markets over the past decade. Yet appetite for Chinese stocks has dwindled among global investors, who were given broader access than ever before through a much-hyped trading link launched in November 2014 to connect the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges. A planned extension of the program to the Shenzhen stock exchange is expected in 2016. After a promising start, investors pulled money from Chinese stocks during three months out of the five months since July, and are on track to record a fourth month of outflows during December.

{"title": "Markets", "date": "28 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING\u0097China's banking regulator released draft rules for fast-growing peer-to-peer, or P2P, lending platforms in a bid to promote their development as a solution to small-business financing difficulties. The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in rules seeking public comment that P2P platformswould be banned from providing guarantees to ?clients, and could work only as intermediaries linking investors with borrowers. Platforms should file for record with local financial regulators after they receive business licenses, the draft rules said. The rules also said that the amount of credit extended on these online financing platforms should be small and that platforms should set a ceiling on the credit that an individual borrower can access in a bid to better manage potential risks. The rules didn't elaborate on the amount or the ceiling. ? P2P lenders should also publish information on their websites on lending turnover, overdue loans and bad loan ratios, according to the draft rules. The regulator also said P2P lenders aren't allowed to sell wealth management products, insurance, funds or trust products. P2P platforms, which fill a gap in the market where the state banking system favors big state companies and small businesses have little access to credit, reported rapid growth in recent years. But as the Chinese economy has lost momentum, some P2P platforms--which are lightly regulated--have run into trouble. At the end of November, there were 2,612 P2P platforms operating normally in China, while more than 1,000, or about 30%, were found to have problems, the regulator said. Grace Zhu "}

Singapore firm eyes an accelerator venture to help mainland entrepreneurs Singapore-based Flex, the world's second-largest electronics manufacturing service provider, plans to launch a new technology accelerator venture in China that will tap into its innovative start-up community. China is still the manufacturing centre of the world, but there's no doubt that more and more innovation is coming out of the country at a rapid pace, Flex chief executive Mike McNamara said. He said Flex, formerly known as Flextronics International, had already started experimenting on recreating its Lab IX initiative in the United States through the firm's network of design and engineering facilities in China. Established in July 2013, Lab IX is an accelerator business that provides a broad range of funding and production support for entrepreneurs and start-ups developing disruptive technologies. It is co-located within Flex's Silicon Valley Innovation Centre in the Californian city of Milpitas. You know why innovation is occurring here in China? It's very heavily oriented towards doing very entrepreneurial things and taking risks, McNamara said.It's very heavily oriented towards doing very entrepreneurial things and taking risksMike McNamara, Flex He added that the consumption power of China's growing middle class was creating opportunities for more products that the market wanted. They get choice. An example is the features [consumers want] on a set-top box. We're now working with a Chinese start-up whose first priority for a set-top box is its karaoke feature, McNamara said. According to a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute, China is uniquely positioned to excel at customer-focused innovation as suppliers try to meet the needs of about 1.3 billion consumers. MGI said Chinese consumers were also happy to accept new products that are not completely refined and eager to share feedback to make them better. It estimated disposable income in the country had risen 10 per cent a year in the past decade. The number of households in the so-called mainstream consuming class - defined as households with annual disposable income of US$17,000 to US$37,000 - is predicted to reach 200 million by 2020. McNamara said Beijing had also helped stimulate innovation with its recent policies. In March, Premier Li Keqiang announced the country's internet plus plan to boost the domestic economy by fostering e-commerce and other online-based business activities. The State Council followed with a series of policies and funding to bolster the country's expertise in various hi-tech market segments, such as semiconductors, robotics and aerospace. According to MGI, a new wave of entrepreneurs has emerged in China as access to early financing rounds has improved dramatically. Early-stage venture funds grew by a factor of 14 between 2009 and 2014, rising to about US$6 billion, the institute said. Almost 70 per cent of early-stage investment was in internet and information technology-related businesses. It said e-commerce giant Alibaba, online search leader Baidu and Tencent had invested more than US$11 billion in about 100 ventures, looking for both investment returns and to fill strategic needs of their businesses.

{"title": "Markets", "date": "27 December 2015", "body": "Behind the biggest market meltdowns of 2015 were familiar culprits: central banks. And more volatility is likely to follow in 2016 as investors navigate the Federal Reserve's gradual exit from easy-money policies after the U.S. central bank raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade. From the Swiss National Bank's shock decision in January to abandon the Swiss franc's link to the euro, to the European Central Bank's disappointing stimulus package in December, a series of central bank decisions have provoked extreme market reactions. In between, the decision by China's central bank in August to weaken the value of its currency fueled fears about the state of the \\b Chinese\\b0  economy that spurred a global stock selloff. The bouts of turmoil highlight markets' growing reliance on the words and actions of central banks in the years following the financial crisis. Rock-bottom interest rates and massive asset purchases designed to kick-start ailing economies have encouraged investors to push into ever-riskier assets in search of returns. That has left many markets vulnerable to sharp reversals when popular trades turn sour. \u0093This year was a sign of things to come, and it will probably get worse before it gets better, said Paul Lambert, head of currency at London-based asset manager Insight Investment. \u0093Central bank policy has pushed many investors beyond their comfort zone. Now we're seeing the consequences. In 2016, the biggest challenge may be the one faced by the most influential central bank: the Fed. U.S. rate-setters have sought to reassure markets that the move up from near-zero rates will be slow. But they're treading a fine line: Let investors know the easy-money party is over, without giving markets a sharp jolt that could spread to the economy. Meanwhile, the ECB and the Bank of Japan continue to grapple with weak economies and low inflation that may force them to ramp up stimulus. Japan's central bank jolted markets when it announced a modest expansion of its quantitative-easing program on Dec. 18, initially boosting Japanese stocks before they turned sharply lower. \u0093I think 2016 will be quite challenging for central banks,'' said Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners LLP and a former economist at the International Monetary Fund. \u0093This is like an 18-wheeler trucker not being sure when and where to turn, but has promised the world that he would use the turn signal in ample time. Compounding the problem are tighter regulations that have limited investment banks' ability to trade large quantities of stocks, bonds and currencies. For investors, that means less liquidity\u0097or the ability to buy or sell assets without moving prices appreciably\u0097and wild market swings when a central bank delivers a surprise. \u0093Investors are vulnerable to more episodes like these in the future,'' said Zhiwei Ren, managing director and portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management Inc., which has $20 billion in assets under management. \u0093Central bank actions have been fueling volatile trading, and in the current low-liquidity environment, holding a crowded position is a recipe for disaster. On Jan. 15, the Swiss franc rocketed by more than 40% against the euro after the SNB abruptly removed its cap on the currency's value\u0097the sharpest one-day move for a major currency in more than 40 years of floating exchange rates. The SNB had been intervening in markets to prevent the franc from climbing too far and hurting Swiss exporters, but threw in the towel after growing uneasy with the enormous pile of euros it had bought. The decision caught out many investors who had bet on a falling franc. December brought another bout of whiplash for currency investors that spilled into stock markets. The euro climbed more than 4% against the dollar after the ECB delivered a smaller stimulus package than many had expected. The surge\u0097a massive daily move for euro-dollar, the world's most heavily traded financial instrument\u0097was just the latest in a series of sharp swings in 2015 as investors tried to second guess the rate at which ECB and Fed policy were headed in opposite directions. The episode highlights another issue for major central banks: how to guide market expectations in a time of uncertainty. In China, monetary-policy makers caused several rounds of market gyrations this year, as investors struggled to interpret signals from a central bank that often fails to clarify its intentions. The People's Bank of China, together with other Chinese regulators, helped fuel an epic run-up in share prices early this year, only to contribute to a dramatic stock-market crash over the summer through a series of conflicting messages. The slump wiped out $5 trillion of value in June and July. The central bank was then front and center in an unprecedented government effort aimed at propping up share prices, pledging to provide unlimited liquidity to aid stock purchases by state companies. As stock investors were still licking their wounds, the central bank stunned the world with a devaluation of the \\b Chinese\\b0  yuan in mid-August. The PBOC said the move was intended to bring the yuan's value more in line with market expectations, but the surprise action triggered a sharp selloff of the yuan and the currencies in some of China's trading partners. Many saw the devaluation as an attempt to shore up China's export sector and a sign that the country's economy was slowing more sharply than thought. If China is serious about its push to open up its financial markets and internationalize the use of its currency, \u0093improving PBOC's communication with investors is very important, said Puay Yeong Goh, a senior economist at Neuberger Berman, an investment-management firm in New York. The tumultuous year has left many investors wary of the risks of placing too much faith in central banks. \u0093Credibility, or rather confidence in central banks has diminished,'' said Jim Caron, global fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which had $404 billion in assets under management at the end of September. \u0093The consequence is that they may not be able to stabilize prices as effectively as they have in the past.

He said Flex, the Nasdaq-listed company previously known as Flextronics International, had \u0093already started experimenting\u0094 on recreating its \u0093Lab IX\u0094 initiative in the United States through the firm's network of design and engineering facilities on the mainland. Established in July 2013, Lab IX is an accelerator business that provides a broad range of funding and production support for entrepreneurs and start-ups developing disruptive technologies. It is co-located within Flex' sprawling Silicon Valley Innovation Centre in the Californian city of Milpitas. \u0093You know why innovation is occurring here in China? It's very heavily oriented towards doing very entrepreneurial things and taking risks,\u0094 McNamara said.It's very heavily oriented towards doing very entrepreneurial things and taking risksMike McNamara, Flex He added that the consumption power of China's growing middle class was creating opportunities for more products that the market wanted. \u0093They get choice. An example is the features [consumers want] on a set-top box. We're now working with a Chinese start-up whose first priority for a set-top box is its karaoke feature,\u0094 McNamara said. According to a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), mainland China is uniquely positioned to excel at \u0093customer-focused innovation\u0094 as suppliers try to meet the needs of about 1.3 billion consumers. MGI said mainland consumers were also \u0093happy to accept new products that are not completely refined and eager to share feedback to make them better\u0094. It estimated that disposable income on the mainland had risen by 10 per cent a year over the past decade. The number of households in the so-called mainstream consuming class - defined as households with annual disposable income worth US$17,000 to US$37,000 - is predicted to reach 200 million by 2020. McNamara said the central government has also helped stimulate innovation with its recent policies. In March, Premier Li Keqiang announced the country's \u0093Internet Plus\u0094 plan to boost the domestic economy by fostering e-commerce and other online-based business activities. The State Council followed with a series of policies and funding support to bolster the country's expertise in various hi-tech market segments, such as semiconductors, robotics and aerospace. According to MGI, a new wave of entrepreneurs has emerged on the mainland as access to early financing rounds has improved dramatically. \u0093Early-stage venture funds grew by a factor of 14 between 2009 and 2014, rising to about US$6 billion,\u0094 MGI said. \u0093Almost 70 per cent of early-stage investment was in internet and information technology-related businesses.\u0094 It said e-commerce giant Alibaba, online search leader Baidu and Tencent had invested more than US$11 billion in about 100 ventures, \u0093looking for both investment returns and to fill strategic needs of their businesses\u0094.

Government bonds pulled back as higher oil prices and rising stock markets sapped demand for haven assets. Gold prices drifted lower as the dollar advanced against the euro. OPENING CALL: After being buffeted in 2015, Australia's stock market isn't likely to see much respite from headwinds in the coming year. CommSec chief economist Craig James lays out a list of factors likely to keep the market in check, including iron-ore and oil prices that are expected to remain low. There is also going to be ongoing uncertainty about U.S. rate increases, the transition in China's economy will continue, and domestic economic growth will only gradually lift back to more \u0093normal growth rates, he says. CommSec forecasts the ASX All Ordinaries index will end 2016 between 5500 and 5700. The index is down 3.5% so far in 2015 after rising the previous three years. EQUITIES: U.S. stocks rallied, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 200 points, as investors piled into shares tied to the commodities sector. A rebound in oil and junk-bond prices this week helped boost investor sentiment, traders said. Wednesday's gains came on the last full trading day before the Christmas holiday. The U.S. stock market will close early on Thursday and remain closed on Friday for Christmas Day. Traders said volumes were light ahead of the holiday, which could exaggerate moves in the market. For the year so far, the S&P 500 has added just 0.3%. The broad-market index is on track for its smallest yearly advance since 2011, when it ended flat. Shares of smaller firms have fared worse this year. The Russell 2000, the benchmark for small-company stocks, has fallen 4.4% so far in 2015. Some of the biggest gainers were sectors that have been hit in recent weeks. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 surged 4.2%. Those stocks have slumped 7.1% this month as oil prices dropped. The S&P 500's materials sector, which includes shares of mining companies, rose 2.4%. For the month, those stocks have slipped 2.6%. The iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the largest high-yield bond exchange-traded fund by assets, added 0.6%. Among individual stocks, Celgene said late Tuesday it reached a settlement in a long-running patent dispute over its flagship blood-cancer drug. Shares surged 9.8%. Caterpillar shares rose 2.2%, boosting the weekly gain to 7.3%. Shares have fallen 24% so far this year. Shares in Hong Kong and Australia made their best year-end push for gains yet, with the latter market up for the sixth straight day, as commodity prices stabilized. FOREX: The dollar advanced against the euro as some investors re-entered trades for the common currency to weaken, predicting the paths for monetary policy between central banks in the eurozone and the U.S. would continue to diverge. Thinned holiday trading volumes continued to pin the dollar in tight ranges against its peers, even after a raft of data showed the U.S. economy is holding steady as consumer sentiment perked up. For 2016, many analysts estimate the dollar will continue to rise against most currencies, including the euro, but those gains will be small compared with its previous rally over the past two years. And investors will need to see improved U.S. numbers before they re-enter trades for a stronger greenback in larger numbers, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union. Investors predicted the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate increase in almost 10 years would lift the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive at a time when other central banks--such as the European Central Bank--are easing policy and weakening their currencies. The lead-up to the Fed's move pushed the dollar to multiyear highs against peers. BONDS: Government bonds in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. pulled back as higher prices for oil and rising stock markets sapped demand for haven assets. Traders say that riskier asset performances, especially crude oil, continue to drive prices in the bond market in the short term. Trading is likely to be thinner than usual with many investors and traders out for the holidays, which may exaggerate part of the price swings in financial markets. The U.S. bond market will close at 2 p.m. ET Thursday and remain shut Friday for Christmas Day. Government bond yields in developed countries remain at low levels from a historical standpoint. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, a foundation for global finance, is near 2.173%, where it traded at the end of last year. The resilience of the bond market has confounded many hedge funds, money managers and bank traders who had expected the yield to rise toward 3% by the end of the year. Municipal bonds and Treasury debt have been winners in the U.S. fixed-income markets this year while corporate bonds lost ground. Municipal bonds have posted a total return--including price gains and interest payments--of 3.19% this year through Tuesday and U.S. government debt overall returned 1.03%, according to Barclays PLC. High-grade corporate bonds posted a total return of negative 0.68%. Bonds sold by lower-rated firms, or junk bonds, were the biggest loser, with a negative total return of 5.28%. COMMODITIES: U.S. oil prices rallied to a two-week high after government data showed an unexpectedly large decline in U.S. stockpiles, a rare reprieve from the flood of oil that had been flowing into storage. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude-oil inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels last week. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted they would rise by 600,000 barrels. Industry group American Petroleum Institute had reported a 3.6-million-barrel decline in oil supplies, sending prices up earlier in the morning. Stockpiles had grown in 11 of the last 12 weeks, deepening the global glut of crude that had sank oil prices by nearly 70% between last year's highs and Tuesday's close. This drawdown isn't enough on its own to suggest a shrinking glut, but traders will be watching to see if it starts a trend, said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston. The EIA said gasoline stockpiles grew 1.1 million barrels, matching analysts' expectations. Distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel, fell by 661,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a 2.1-million-barrel increase. Gold prices drifted lower, weighed down by a stronger dollar.

{"title": "Business", "date": "23 December 2015", "body": "But the window for investment may not remain open for long. The year 2016 will likely represent a peak for China NPLs, said Barclays China financials analyst Alex Zhou, with the figure likely to moderate from 2017. In 2015, the Chinese bank industry saw its highest level of non-performing loans since the onset of the global financial crisis. At the end of the third quarter, the total pile amounted to 1.18 trillion yuan, representing 1.59 per cent of banking assets. Under the category of \u0093special mention loans\u0094, the murky classification for loans which mainland banks have been slow to reconcile as actual bad debt on their books, the total figure has also reached 2.81 trillion yuan, eating up some 3.7 per cent of banking assets. To make recovery from the loans, banks have been selling off the dud portfolios to asset management companies for just 30 - 35 cents for ever yuan they have loaned out this year. Pricing has dropped compared to 2014, when they would have got 40 - 50 cents per yuan. Some banks under pressure to resolve NPL issues even provided financing trusts and third-party asset managers - just to have the assets taken off their hands. It is a short cut in an effort to create an illusion for higher negotiated prices than what they could normally get in the market today their recovery process, said Wilson Pang, partner in charge of NPL advisory at KPMGChina. Daniel Jim, managing director at Tripod Management said: \u0093If you try to buy something at 30 cents on the dollar and trade them back to 60 to 70 cents, it is still a good workout.\u0094 On average, Zhou said AMCs have been making 19 per cent return per year on average. But Pang said the present level of pricing is not representative of the fair value. There are now more sellers than buyers in the market. With more participants anticipated to be allowed to enter the market next year, there could be a better chance of correcting the market imbalance and allow the assets to achieve better pricing. Against the rapid NPL expansion, big AMCs led by the likes of Cinda and Huarong have come to a point of saturation, where they have not invested in more resources to keep up. Instead, they have cut down the time they spend on turning around the portfolios - from the previous three to four years cycle to just one year this year. Zhou said more companies are turning themselves into wholesalers. Pang said:\u0093The folks at the asset management companies have their hands go limp just from buying bad debt portfolio from the big-four, big-five state-owned banks. In city commercial banks', where loan size average for just a few hundred to a thousand yuan, they could be in a much worse place.\u0094 City commercial banks, the 134 players whose profile are the most vulnerable and the smallest in the industry, have this year ploughed into the IPO market to recapitalize their fragile balance sheets both in the Hong Kong and domestic bourses this year, to investors' mixed response. Ling Gan, the director in charge of city commercial banks supervision at the China Banking Regulatory Commission told press last week city banks' level of dud loans is now only 1.45 per cent, totaling 121.4 billion yuan. But most analysts in the market believe the figure may be understated, and is not representative of the risk of deterioration in their business profile. Pang said: \u0093For small banks' NPL ratio to remain at a level of only 1.45 per cent would imply they have superior client quality and credit management skills comparing even to the industry's \u0091big 5' state-owned banks.\u0094 City banks had been one of the key forced recipients of the 3.2 trillion yuan worth of low-yielding local government bonds, which swapped them out of the higher yielding loans that local governments had owed, under the fiscal reform carried out by the Ministry of Finance this year. Finance minister Lou Jiwei told the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Tuesday the bond swap had helped resolved the local government debt payable for this year. But under slowing land sales and worsening fiscal positions, he warned local government's ability to repay their debt is worsening. Local governments have been explicitly forbidden to add new debt to their balance sheet under the central government's fiscal reform announced in November 2013. But without stable cash flows, more local governments have been making new borrowings masked as equity financing - a rising phenomenon the ministry is struggling to keep check of. The central government has vowed to lower the nation's level of leverage as a key focus of its work, along with removing excess capacity in industries beleaguering the nation next year.

{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "23 December 2015", "body": "Bumpy Road for Corporate Bonds For European corporate-bond investors, 2015 looks like a year to forget. Euro-denominated investment-grade bonds have lost money, down 0.34% according to Barclays indexes. But this year has some valuable lessons for 2016. The start of 2015 offered reason for hope. The spread between corporate- and government-bond yields narrowed sharply as fever built around the European Central Bank's much-anticipated quantitative-easing program. By mid-April, investment-grade bond buyers were up 1.8%. But the first few months of the year were as good as it got. In April and May, asharp selloff in underlying government bonds first hammered total returns; then company problems such as those at Volkswagen and in the commodities sectors took their toll. By December investment-grade bonds had crawled back into positive territory, only to be hit by the ECB's botched monetary-policy decisions. The result: Spreads are ending the year nearly 0.5 percentage point wider than they started, and total returns are negative for the first time since 2008, based on Barclays data. After 2014's returns of 8.4%, 2015 has been a washout. Some now argue that the wider starting point for spreads augurs well for 2016. But even on this basis, return forecasts are on the slim side. Meanwhile, the story of 2015 points to the risks that bond markets are running. First, the reach of loose monetary policy only goes so far. Even if the ECB were to go further into unconventional territory in 2016, it isn't clear corporate bonds would necessarily be a beneficiary. Monetary policy can only create the backdrop for growth; it certainly can't address fundamental corporate problems. Second, this year has been good to corporate borrowers. They have loaded up on some of the cheapest debt in history while pushing maturities out. Investment-grade nonfinancial issuance stood at 245 billion euros ($267 billion) by Dec. 18, the second-best year on record, according to Societe Generale; more than half of the issuance carried maturities of seven years or longer. But low coupons and long maturities are a poor mix when trouble hits. Third, some of the frequent concerns around bond-market liquidity have had a tangible impact this year. That is the case in the U.S., where high-yield funds have hit trouble, and in Europe, where price moves have been larger than might be expected when companies have faced problems. Thus wider spreads don't sound reassuring for investors faced with higher levels of risk and a less supportive policy backdrop. This year was tough; next year might just offer more of the same. -- Richard Barley Big U.S. Banks: A Fear Trade That Didn't Pay Warren Buffett has advised investors to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful. While that might often be a good strategy, it has proved painfully wrong for investors who tried to pick up bank stocks on the cheap at the height of the financial crisis. The worst week in the 119-year history of Dow Jones Industrial Average ended on Oct. 10, 2008. Stocks dropped 18% from Monday to Friday, leaving many investors stunned but some looking for bargains. That push-pull of fear and greed could be seen in the intraday moves of the stock market, with the Dow plunging 697 points after the opening bell only to surge 322 points in the last half-hour of trading. Amid this record-breaking volatility, investors snapped up bank stocks. A Dow Jones index of that sector rose 9% on that Friday. Shares of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs saw single-digit percentage rises, while J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup shares were up by about 17%. The outlier on that Friday was Morgan Stanley. Despite reports that a capital injection from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group was still on track, shares fell 9% on Friday, Oct. 10. While the broader stock market has made a tremendous comeback, it hasn't been kind to those who got greedy about bank stocks during those fearful days. The S&P 500 has gained 125.5%, while the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up 36.9%. The picture is even starker for individual banks. Bank of America shares now trade 18.93% below their Oct. 10, 2008, closing price. Citigroup shares are off 62.59%. Even the big banks with the strongest postcrisis share performance haven't kept up with the broader market. Goldman Sachs shares are up 100%. Wells Fargo is up 90.5%. J.P. Morgan has risen 56.8%. The only one of the top six banks whose shares have beaten the market is the only one that sank on that volatile Friday in 2008: Morgan Stanley's shares have risen 229.1% since Oct. 10, 2008's closing bell. But this is largely an artifact of just how far Morgan Stanley's shares had fallen by Oct. 10, 2008. Investors who bought the prior Friday or the following Friday also would have underperformed the market. Trying to climb 2008's wall of worry turned out to be an expensive mistake. -- John Carney China Vanke Can Afford To Wait China Vanke is battling to fend off an unwanted suitor. The world's largest property developer by sales has time on its side. Vanke says it is going to issue more shares as part of an asset-restructuring plan. This is meant to unseat its biggest shareholder -- Baoneng Group. Baoneng is a privately-owned Chinese property-to-finance conglomerate that now owns 22% of the developer, surpassing state-owned China Resources Group as Vanke's largest shareholder. Vanke would probably want state-owned enterprises with deep pockets as its potential allies, such as China Resources. But it holds 15% of Vanke and can't own more than 30% without making an offer for the whole company. There is also the question of price. Vanke's Shenzhen-listed stock is no longer cheap; a new investor would likely demand a deep discount. Other shareholders won't like that. Key here could be Anbang Insurance Group. Baoneng and Anbang together own 27% of the company, a big enough block to potentially derail Vanke's plan. Anbang hasn't commented on the situation. There is one thing working in favor of Vanke: the leverage Baoneng has used. According to filings, Baoneng has put down only one-third of the capital it used to buy Vanke shares, while the rest came from unknown investors in wealth management products. A drawn-out battle could heap extra financing costs on Baoneng. Good things come to those who wait. -- Jacky Wong Overheard You can have too much of a good thing. Rough-diamond prices fell this year after a buildup of polished stones in Chinese retailers' inventories weighed on demand. There are more rocks elsewhere, too. This has been an abundant year for very large diamond discoveries. Royal Bank of Canada notes that although not all discoveries are disclosed, eight stones bigger than 200 carats have been sold this year, compared with three last year and one in 2013. This excludes three recent discoveries by Lucara Diamond Corp., including the second-largest stone ever found. Prices of very large stones have so far proved resilient. But there are only a handful of buyers for these trophy diamonds. The flow of big stones could continue: Miners like Lucara and Gem Diamonds have invested in equipment to help prevent accidental breakage in processing. The diamond glut may not only be a mass-market phenomenon. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "World News: World Watch", "date": "23 December 2015", "body": "THAILAND Airline Passes Review By European Agency Thai Airways International PCL said it passed an assessment conducted by the European Aviation Safety Agency that allows it to continue flying to the European Union. The announcement came after the EU's executive arm held off from adding Thailand to a blacklist of countries whose carriers are banned from the flying to the region. Concern about such a ban had been building in the country after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration downgraded its safety rating for Thailand's civil aviation agency, saying it didn't comply with FAA standards. The FAA move didn't directly affect any Thai carriers. Thai Airways doesn't operate any flights to the U.S. But it did raise concerns about European regulators following suit, which would have been a significant blow to Thai Airways. It flies to 11 destinations in Europe and generates a third of its revenue from those routes. -- James Hookway --- CHINA Local Governments To Hit Debt Ceiling China's local government debt is expected to stand at 16 trillion yuan ($2.47 trillion) at the end of 2015, matching a ceiling imposed in August, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported, citing data from the nation's top legislature. China's local-government debt is under control, said the budgetary affairs commission of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. The 2015 cap on local-government debt comes on the top of the 15.4 trillion yuan in debt owed by local governments as of the end of 2014. The cap doesn't include indirect liabilities, which officials said in August totaled 8.6 trillion yuan. -- Grace Zhu --- INDIA Small Plane Crashes Shortly After Takeoff A small Indian Border Security Force transport plane with 10 people aboard crashed shortly after takeoff in the Indian capital on Tuesday. A spokesman for the border force said rescue operations were under way and he couldn't provide casualty figures. He said an investigation into the cause of the crash was also under way. The plane, a Beechcraft Super King, went down in southwest Delhi at about 10 a.m. local time, the BSF said. -- Aditi Malhotra --- UNITED KINGDOM Budget Deficit Widened Last Month The U.K.'s budget deficit widened in November compared with a year earlier, suggesting Treasury chief George Osborne is at risk of overshooting his borrowing goals for the full fiscal year. The government borrowed GBP 14.2 billion ($21.2 billion) in November to cover the shortfall between taxes and spending, a 10% increase from the year-earlier month, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. The data show that during the first eight months of the fiscal year, Mr. Osborne borrowed GBP 66.9 billion of the GBP 68.9 billion forecast for the full 12 months to March. Those figures exclude the debt of British housing associations, which are due to be included in official public-finance figures in early 2016. They also exclude the debts of banks brought into public ownership during the financial crisis. Tuesday's figures suggest that the chancellor of the exchequer is falling behind schedule in his efforts to push Britain's public finances into surplus by 2020. The ONS said the widening of November's deficit occurred in part because government finances benefited a year earlier from fines for financial-sector misconduct that weren't repeated this year. -- Jason Douglas and Jon Sindreu --- IRAN Russia Considers $5 Billion Loan Russia may provide Iran a $5 billion loan in 2016, Russian Trade Minister Denis Manturov said, state news agencies reported. Russia, which has been hit by Western sanctions since it annexed Crimea in March 2014, has been increasingly strengthening its ties with nations like Iran and China.

{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "23 December 2015", "body": "Property Tussle Is Matter of Time China Vanke's plan to fend off its unwanted suitor may not be smooth sailing. But the world's largest property developer by sales has time on its side. In the latest high-profile takeover battle in China, Vanke says it is going to issue more shares as part of an asset-restructuring plan. It isn't clear how many shares it will issue. However, it is obvious that whatever restructuring it is planning is meant to unseat its biggest shareholder, Baoneng Group. Baoneng is a privately owned property-to-finance conglomerate that now owns 22% of the developer, surpassing state-owned China Resources Group as Vanke's largest shareholder. The company, through its subsidiaries Jushenghua and Foresea Life Insurance, has snapped up shares in Vanke aggressively. Vanke's restructuring also could involve some asset purchases. But the stock placement is most clearly designed to ward off Baoneng. The question is who is going to buy all these shares. Vanke would probably want state-owned enterprises with deep enough pockets as its potential allies. China Resources Group is one possible candidate. But it holds 15% of Vanke and, under local rules, would be required to make an offer for the whole company if it owned more than 30%. There also is the question of price, since this is likely to be a private placement to a handpicked investor. After surging 68% in just the past month to fetch three times book value, Vanke's Shenzhen-listed stock is no longer cheap. So a new investor would likely demand a deep discount to the current share price. Other existing shareholders won't like the discounted issuance. Key here could be Anbang Insurance Group, a private insurer that recently bought a 5% stake in Vanke and stands to lose big money on paper if the shares fall. Baoneng and Anbang together own 27% of the company, a big enough block to potentially derail Vanke's plan. Share issuance in China requires approval from two-thirds of votes in a shareholders' meeting, besides regulators' nod. Anbang hasn't commented on the current situation. Issuing new shares could take months. Yet even if the fiasco drags on, there is one thing working in favor of Vanke's executives: the leverage Baoneng has used. According to filings, Baoneng has put down only a third of the capital it used to buy Vanke shares, while the rest came from unknown investors in wealth-management products that are guaranteed unspecified yields. Wealth-management products are a popular way in China to raise capital without being labeled as borrowing. So a drawn-out battle could heap extra financing costs on Baoneng. Good things come to those who wait. -- Jacky Wong Italy Is Market Winner From Spanish Election Over the course of this year, Spain and Italy have swapped places in the affections of government bond investors, with Rome gaining over Madrid. The messy outcome of Spain's general election means the start of 2016 should see Italy remain the favored play. Spain's election, like those elsewhere in Europe, is redrawing the political map as a result of the sovereign-debt crisis. Itmarks the end of two-party politics: The Popular Party and the Socialists gained just over half the votes, down from nearly three-quarters in 2011. It also has generatedpotentially extended uncertainty. The new forces of left-wing Podemos and centrist Ciudadanos have won sizable numbers of seats, but there looks to be little chance of a stable government being formed quickly. The vote may yet need to be rerun early in 2016. Spain has been the strongest-growing of the Big Four eurozone economies this year, expanding around 3%. It also has been lauded as having introduced labor-market overhauls that have helped unlock this performance. Political risk will cloud an impressive economic picture. The clash of interests is clear. While investors have welcomed economic developments in Spain, the news hasn't been good enough for voters. Unemployment has fallen more than five percentage points but is still over 20%. Wage restraint is good news for markets but harder to stomach for voters: Since 2013 the average year-over-year increase in wages registered in collective bargaining is 0.6%, versus 3% in the period between 2000 and 2008, Barclays notes. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, meanwhile, is presiding over aneconomy that has returned to growth. Ten-year Italian yields have fallen this year, while those for Spain have risen even as Italy faces a larger debt burden, the need to carry out deeper changes and a less dynamic outlook. Spain's underperformance may be limited by continued bond purchases by the European Central Bank. Portugal's electoral turmoil only resulted in a short-lived bout of pressure on bonds, after all. But political clarity will be needed for Spanish bonds to regain favor. Italian bonds have returned 4.9% this year, according to Barclays, outstripping a return of 2% for Spain. The prospects for next year are dimmer for all given the low level of yields, but Italy still looks a safer bet. -- Richard Barley Dividends Overboard at Teekay Corp Investors in Teekay Corp. launched the lifeboats last week despite a reassuring signal from the captain. The diminutive shipping company, which presides over a huge fleet of energy-related vessels through related entities, spooked the market by slicing its dividend by 90% to conserve capital. Its stock plunged by nearly 60% after already having dropped by two-thirds in the year to date. It's not surprising that it went down -- it's surprising that there was an extra zero at the end, says John Buckingham, chief investment officer at AFAM Capital, which owns some shares. It is a sign of how jittery markets are about once-secure sources of income, particularly from energy-related companies, becoming suspect. But while some crept back into Kinder Morgan Inc. after it reduced its dividend by three-quarters early this month, smaller, more-complicated Teekay may languish a while longer. It recently had reassured investors about its dividend, saying it was targeting 15% to 20% annual growth in coming years. But two of its master limited partnerships cut their dividends and, with its already depressed share price, management decided that raising cash to fund future growth from the equity market seemed expensive. Following last week's tumble, the stock is now prohibitively pricey. On value alone, Teekay now looks enticing. But turnover some 50 times normal late last week suggest its income-hungry shareholders weren't prepared to wait for that ship to come in. -- Spencer Jakab Overheard The financial crisis provides a line in the sand for numerous indicators -- unemployment, stock prices, you name it. Lowest since or highest since often mentions dates in 2008 or 2009. But Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, just broke through the trough hit following Lehman's collapse to a price unseen since 2004. Back then, of course, $36 a barrel, not being a round number, didn't spark anxious headlines. It was dates like March 2005 and January 2008, when $50 and $100 were breached, respectively, when hand-wringing ensued. Ironically, though, investors might relish a bit of stability or even a bounce in energy prices as they head in the opposite direction than in 2004. Today, it is companies and emerging countries' creditworthiness rather than consumers that are the focus of worry. What a difference 11 years makes.

{"title": "Beijing Remakes Its Growth Strategy", "date": "22 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING -- Chinese leaders approved an economic blueprint for next year that emphasizes tackling long-term problems and reflects a realization that debt and investment can no longer power the world's second-largest economy. The plan, laid out at a closed-door conclave of senior party officials led by President Xi Jinping, comes as the country's massive buildup of debt and legions of factories pumping out unwanted goods astride towers of empty apartments have become severe drags on economic output. At the annual year-end meeting of China's top economic mandarins, called the Central Economic Work Conference, senior officials who gathered at the heavily guarded Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing considered prospects that the country's sluggish growth could linger as the old model has reached its limits, according to a senior Chinese official with direct knowledge of the meeting. They discussed the potential for a long period of flat or stagnant growth, the official said. The economy will follow an L-shaped path, and it won't be a V-shaped path going forward, the official said, while ruling out any chances of China launching another round of aggressive stimulus measures like the one initiated in late 2008 to combat the global financial crisis. Still, worries over a potential hard landing in China's economy are unwarranted, the senior official said. The official pointed to monetary and fiscal levers Beijing can still pull to help spur growth as well as the leadership's determination to proceed with reforms that could put the economy on a stronger footing in the long run. China had about $3.438 trillion in foreign exchange reserves as of the end of November. The plan itself wasn't publicly disclosed, and state media reports were vague about how the goals would be implemented. But the broad outlines illustrate Beijing's latest effort to try to rebalance its economy by finding new sources of growth. Senior leaders at the meeting also looked at tapping into Chinese consumers' rising demand for safer food, better medical care and other quality-of-life improvements. We're not facing a lack of demand, the official with knowledge of the discussions said. What we need to do is to carry out supply-side reforms to meet the unmet demand. The plan hammered out at the closed-door meeting, which started on Friday and ended Monday morning, nods to a host of chronic problems hindering China's transformation into an economy driven more by consumption and less by debt and investment. The plan calls for reducing industrial overcapacity, slashing its stockpile of unsold homes, lowering costs for businesses and mitigating financial risks, according to a communique released by China's official Xinhua News Agency after the conclusion of the meeting Monday. Meanwhile, the plan reveals a modestly dovish tone on fiscal and monetary policies. It said China will run a larger fiscal deficit by cutting taxes -- a change from past policies of expanding the deficit by increasing government expenditure. It also said monetary policy will be flexible, indicating it could continue loosening access to credit. The leadership also set its annual growth target for next year at the meeting, but that figure won't be disclosed until China's legislature convenes in March, the senior official said. Economists widely expect Beijing to announce a gross domestic product target for next year that is lower than this year's benchmark of about 7%, which would signal a desire to make reforms at the expense of short-term growth. China is set to report its slowest annual economic growth rate in 25 years, and many economists said it would struggle to reach the 7% goal. President Xi has signaled that growth must be at least 6.5% annually for the next five years if China is to double per-capita growth and income by 2020 over 2010 levels. Still, some remain doubtful that Beijing will implement the changes that could obtain the growth rate officials find crucial to their survival. We're on track for reform failure, said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. He pointed out that Beijing made similar promises to cut industrial overcapacity two years ago. The renewed pledges come after China's yearlong effort to stoke demand through interest-rate reductions and government spending, which has done little to bolster the economy. Many economists say those measures have saddled Chinese companies and various levels of government with more debt, potentially putting the economy at greater risk. Corporate debt now amounts to 160% of China's gross domestic product, according to ratings firm Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. That's up from 98% in 2008 and compares with a current U.S. level of 70%. One way to do that is to target overcapacity that has resulted in poor productivity and inefficient allocation of credit and other resources, according to the communique released by Xinhua. China suffers from a glut of steel factories, glassworks and other emblems of the old economy. Next year looks bleak as demand weakens and lower labor costs in neighboring countries make China less competitive, said Chen Qiaoqi, general manager of export-import company Shanghai Shuttle Bridge Developments Co. and its affiliated logistics arm. Ms. Chen said banks are reluctant to lend to small companies like hers and real borrowing costs are still high. A main reason: competing against state-owned companies that enjoy preferential payment terms with suppliers and easy access to funding, she said. They can continue operating even when they lose money, said Ms. Chen. If labor costs keep rising and financing is squeezed further we'll be driven out of business. --- Mark Magnier contributed to this article. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "World", "date": "22 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING\u0097Authorities outlined allegations against seven labor activists detained earlier this month, claiming they used advocacy as a cover to disturb public order and violate workers' rights, state media said. In a lengthy report late Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency detailed police allegations against Zeng Feiyang and six others, who were detained in Guangdong province during what scholars and rights advocates have condemned as a crackdown on labor activism. Mr. Zeng and his associates, according to Xinhua, have \u0093long received financial assistance from overseas while intervening in domestic labor disputes, gravely disturbing public order and severely trampling upon workers' interests. Xinhua said Mr. Zeng was also accused of fraud, adultery and embezzlement, saying the 41-year-old activist had used his labor nonprofit\u0097the Guangzhou-based Panyu Migrant Workers Center\u0097to enrich himself by funneling funds from foreign donors into his own bank account. Xinhua didn't name Mr. Zeng's foreign donors. Activists say China Labour Bulletin\u0097a Hong Kong-based watchdog\u0097has been a source of funding for Mr. Zeng's nonprofit, though the scale and timing of the donations weren't clear. A spokesman for China Labour Bulletin declined to comment on the matter. The Xinhua report cited interviews with police, workers and the detained activists themselves, though the agency quoted only one of the activists, Tang Huanxing, whom it said had offered a confession. Xinhua said the seven activists\u0097six men and a woman\u0097have been placed under \u0093criminal coercive measures, which is a form of detention that typically precedes prosecution. Mr. Zeng and a co-worker, Zhu Xiaomei, were accused of \u0093assembling crowds to disturb public order when they were detained early this month, according to their associates. He Xiaobo, a 40-year-old activist in the city of Foshan, was detained over alleged embezzlement, his wife said. It wasn't clear what precise allegations have been made against the other four activists. None of the seven could be reached for comment. Their lawyers and relatives say they haven't been able to arrange meetings with the detained activists, despite several attempts over the past three weeks. Scholars and rights advocates decried the allegations against Mr. Zeng and his associates, characterizing the Xinhua report as a smear campaign. They also criticized the detentions, saying it signals Beijing's growing anxiety over a rise in worker unrest prompted by slowing economic growth. The crackdown, scholars say, also dovetailed Beijing's growing repression of civil-society groups, heightened monitoring of social media, and sharpened warnings against the spread of Western ideas and influences. \u0093The direction of Xi Jinping's policy has been quite clear from the start: Push the [official trade unions] to become more capable of managing workers, while steadily reducing the space for grass roots NGOs, labor scholars and labor lawyers to operate, said Ellen Friedman, a retired American trade unionist who has collaborated on labor research with mainland academics and activists. China Labour Bulletin counted more than 2,600 strikes and labor protests on the mainland so far this year, far surpassing the 1,379 incidents recorded in the whole of 2014. Many of these protests took place in Guangdong's Pearl River Delta region, fueled by unpaid wages and factory closures in the sprawling industrial zone that produces more than a quarter of China's exports. Scholars say the crackdown appeared to target veteran advocates who focused on advising workers on how to negotiate collectively during workplace disputes. The practice is sensitive in China, where state-run unions are the only legal form of organized labor, though workers say official trade unions often don't represent their interests and side with businesses during disputes. Mr. Zeng's NGO is among a number of Guangdong-based nonprofits that promoted collective bargaining. In its Tuesday report, Xinhua cited workers' representatives in a recent shoe factory dispute as accusing Mr. Zeng and his associates of manipulating workers by encouraging them to go on strike and make \u0093unrealistic demands in negotiations with employers. These tactics, according to Xinhua, had put workers' safety and financial interests at risk. In its crackdown this month, Guangdong police also interrogated more than 20 other activists, according to those questioned. Many of them said they were asked about Mr. Zeng, his associates and their activities. Ms. Friedman, the retired American unionist, said police in Guangzhou interrogated her on Dec. 11 during a recent trip there, posing questions about her work in China, her relationship with local labor activists and academics, among other issues. \u0093The detentions have caused a climate of fear, said Tim Pringle, a China labor scholar at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \u0093Removing people who know how to provide assistance to workers, and intimidating other NGOs as well as workers in the process, is more likely to increase the probability of social disorder rather than reduce it. Activists said Xinhua's report marked the latest effort by Chinese authorities to shape public opinion on politically sensitive cases, by presenting what appeared to be a definitive conclusion on the cases before the completion of legal proceedings. In July, state media reports portrayed a Beijing-based law firm as a criminal gang and featured what it said were confessions by the accused lawyers, who were detained amid a broad sweep against human-rights lawyers.

{"title": "Weary Asian Bonds Get Help From Fed", "date": "22 December 2015", "body": "The U.S. Federal Reserve's first rate increase in almost a decade gave Asian bond markets an unlikely boost at the end of one of their weakest years, amid slower growth, rising borrowing costs and money flowing out of emerging markets. Bonds in Asia were on track to have their worst December in five years until the Fed's dovish tone set off a rally in global markets. Investors focused on the [Fed's] commitment to a gradual cycle and also took comfort in the notion that the central bank will continue to . . . maintain the size of its balance sheet, said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Dollar-denominated bonds in Asia outside of Japan are up 2.9% year to date. Except for taper-tantrum-scarred 2013, when bonds lost 1.4%, this year is the worst for Asia bonds since the global financial crisis in 2008, according to the J.P. Morgan Asia Credit Index. The markets had drawn in investors with returns of 14% in 2012 and 8% last year, making them top performers in the low-yielding bond world. This year's lukewarm bond performance in the region also comes as the selloff in U.S. high-yield bonds has heightened concerns about emerging-market debt, which is deemed to be the next most-vulnerable area. The volatility in U.S. junk bonds is a wake-up call [for investors] to go back to the fundamentals and check whether their yield compensations are sufficient to cover the credit risks, said Maurice Meijers, fixed-income senior vice president at Robeco. Mr. Meijers said he thinks Asian bonds, in particular high-yield debt issued by Chinese real-estate companies, are overvalued. They have strong tactical support from local investors. . .but their fundamentals don't really support the value, he said. So unlike Latin American issuers, such as those from Brazil, that experienced significant corrections, Asian debt hasn't really been repriced and remains unattractive, Mr. Meijers said. High-yield bonds in the region have fared better than their investment-grade peers, registering a total return of 5.5%, after a combined 15% return over the previous two years. The success of high-yield bonds is something of a surprise, because Chinese property developers account for the bulk of the sector. And those companies have been hurt by China's weak property market, although they were helped by six interest rate cuts and a bond rally that let them tap the domestic debt market. China's loosening monetary cycle has a bigger impact on Chinese debt than the U.S. rate increase, said Hao Hong, managing director at Bank of Communications Co. The low returns in the bond market reflect the weakening fundamentals in Asia. Defaults are rising, with companies such as Kaisa Group Holdings and China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd. missing their debt obligations earlier this year. And the higher interest rates being charged to some companies could further slow growth. We think the credit cycle in the near term has peaked, mainly due to the moderating economic environment in the region coupled with continuing weak global demand, said Arthur Lau, co-head of emerging-market fixed income at PineBridge Investments. He expects bond yields, which move inversely to prices, to rise somewhat in the near term. Over the past five years, Asian countries and companies have borrowed heavily in U.S. dollars, raising $723.6 billion, according to the data provider Dealogic -- nearly triple the amount from 2006 to 2010, thanks to low interest rates and the debt-fueled growth model in the region. Now, the companies have to refinance up to $477.4 billion in the next five years, when funding costs are likely to climb and profits weaken. The good news is that any direct impact from the U.S. junk-bond selloff might be contained. The portion of Asia bonds sold to American investors has been shrinking over the past few years, mainly because of an expansion in local demand in Asia. This year, an average of 17% of new Asian debt was sold to U.S. investors, down from 21% last year. That compared with the recent peak of 37% in 2008, according to Asia Investment Advisors Ltd., which tracks Asia bond sales. At the same time, Asia-based buyers pocketed almost two-thirds of new dollar bonds in the region this year, up from one-third seven years ago, the consulting firm said. Local investors, who might know the companies better, are more likely to stick around during volatile periods than are foreigners. But foreign investors can still hurt Asian markets because of spillover effects from selloffs overseas. The worry is whether the whole high-yield space will go through a correction. Then Asia won't completely escape the effect, said Dilip Parameswaran, chief executive of Asia Investment Advisors Ltd.

{"title": "World", "date": "21 December 2015", "body": "Relations between China and the U.S. entered a newly antagonistic phase, most notably over cybersecurity and Beijing's island-building in the disputed South \\b China\\b0  Sea. In the buildup to President Xi Jinping's U.S. visit in September, President Barack Obama threatened sanctions on Chinese entities over cyberattacks, while senior U.S. officials said they had drawn up options to challenge China's territorial claims. Some U.S. presidential candidates even called for Mr. Xi's visit to be downgraded. In the end, Mr. Xi was granted the full honors of a state visit, and the two sides agreed not to direct or support cybertheft for commercial gain\u0097leaving aside the question of cyberespionage by government or military actors. They also reaffirmed a pledge to work together on climate change\u0097one of the few areas where they appear able to cooperate. But Mr. Xi's surprise commitment in Washington not to \u0093militarize China's Spratly Island installations was too vague to ease the pressure on Mr. Obama from his own military advisers and from allies and partners in Asia. A month later, a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of one of China's artificial islands in what U.S. officials said was the first \u0093freedom of navigation patrol in the area since 2012. At least two Chinese warships \u0093shadowed the destroyer, the USS Lassen. Although China protested and said its military would respond with \u0093all necessary measures, the fallout has been limited, with regular ship visits and other military exchanges continuing. Since the five-hour patrol by the Lassen, the Pentagon has been careful not to provoke Beijing. Pentagon officials have said they would conduct about eight such patrols a year. The operation was the culmination of months of debate within the Obama administration about how to counter China's aggressive island-building campaign, which expanded islands within the Spratly chain from a total of 2,000 acres to more than 3,000 acres during 2015. The U.S. government said Dec. 16 it would sell $1.83 billion in weaponry to Taiwan, the first sale in four years. Jeremy Page and Gordon Lubold Beijing's grip on economy slips It became increasingly evident this year that China's days of double-digit growth are behind it and their legacy\u0097high debt and massive overcapacity\u0097couldn't be ignored. As manufacturing and property investment swooned, Beijing intervened in its falling stock market, then depreciated its currency without warning, sending shock waves through financial markets. This underscored the world's growing dependence on China for growth as commodity prices tanked, multilateral agencies repeatedly pared down global growth forecasts and markets lowered expectations in the face of a parade of weak Chinese data. Few economists see a quick fix for an economy with too many factories spewing out too many unwanted goods in the shadow of too many empty apartments. The solution, hardly easy for a one-party state obsessed with control: embrace deep structural changes that attack vested interests and weaken the state's hand. China made some progress, reining in local government debt, taking steps to open its capital account and cutting red tape to encourage entrepreneurs. But fundamental restructuring promised in late 2013 to let the market play a decisive role in the economy made little progress. A plan unveiled to make fewer and more powerful state-owned companies amid continued preferential access to capital and markets seemed like a step backward to many economists. In a bid to blunt the impact of a rapidly aging population, Beijing loosened its decades-old one-child campaign. Meantime, the U.S., Japan and 10 other nations around the Pacific reached a broad accord in October to lower trade barriers in a challenge in China's influence in the region. The International Monetary Fund added the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies in a largely symbolic sign of China's growing economic clout. Mark Magnier Iran nuclear pact cracks door open The nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers in July represented a historic mending of fences after years of estrangement, but many opponents worry the accord will embolden the Islamic Republic and its proxies amid growing regional instability. The agreement, which put curbs on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, had to overcome stiff opposition in Congress, including from Mr. Obama's Democratic allies. Critics cited the danger that Iran poses to Israel and other Middle Eastern allies. Supporters said the pact would allow for unprecedented scrutiny of Iran's nuclear program. Iran's ultraconservative Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has declared the deal doesn't mark a move toward rapprochement with Washington and that Iran would continue to oppose U.S. policies, despite a common interest in fighting Islamic State. While hopes ran high in Iran that the deal would give a boost to President Hassan Rouhani, whose moderate administration spearheaded Iran's negotiations, a hard-line backlash has included arrests of artists, journalists and businessmen. Asa Fitch and Jay Solomon Latin America targets corruption Anticorruption and other probes roiled Latin America, leading to the ouster of Guatemala's president and the possible impeachment of Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff. Huge street protests led by a change-hungry middle class in many Latin American cities have bolstered the power of prosecutors. A freer press has gotten better at uncovering malfeasance. \u0093There's a combination of more awareness by parts of the population, of some institutions working and of some laws having effect, said Alejandro Salas, regional director of Transparency International, a good-governance group. In Brazil, more than 100 executives and politicians have been arrested, and some convicted, in a kickback and money laundering investigation involving contracts with Petrobras, the state-run oil giant. President Rousseff hasn't been implicated and denied wrongdoing. But she faces possible impeachment for allegedly manipulating Brazil's public accounts to hide a growing deficit amid the public anger caused by the scandal. In Guatemala, a bribery probe by a U.N.-sponsored agency drove President Otto P\u00e9rez from office and into jail in September. Trial awaits a former president of neighboring El Salvador accused of purloining international funds earmarked for earthquake victims. These high-profile investigations \u0093strengthened the principle that the judiciary is the custodian of rule of law, said lawyer Ricardo Monner-Sans, a prominent Argentine anticorruption activist. Foreign authorities have stepped in where local officials can't or won't prosecute. A U.S. grand jury has indicted 27 people, many of them prominent Latin Americans\u0097including a former Honduran president\u0097as part of a bribery scheme for the award of broadcasting and marketing rights for regional soccer games. U.S. prosecutors are pursuing alleged money laundering and embezzlement inside PdVSA, Venezuela's national oil company. U.S. narcotics agents in October arrested two nephews of the country's first lady, Cilia Flores, on cocaine-smuggling charges. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's handpicked investigator absolved him in August of wrongdoing in his wife's purchase of a mansion from a government contractor. The case helped drive Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto's popularity to the lowest level of any sitting Mexican president in decades. Dudley Althaus Erdogan's big year Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emerged triumphant from a roller coaster year, consolidating his power at home and expanding his global influence as Western allies turned to Ankara for help in curbing threats from the Middle East. Mr. Erdogan started by quashing corruption allegations, advancing peace talks with Kurdish rebels, and pushing to empower the mostly symbolic presidency. But voters skeptical of Mr. Erdogan's ambitions delivered a hung parliament in June elections, prompting coalition negotiations that went nowhere. Amid the political uncertainty, Turkey's lira plummeted to record lows, fighting flared with Kurdish separatists and Islamic State suicide-bombings killed 135 people. Mr. Erdogan called snap elections in November that reinstated his party and secured concessions from the European Union for Turkey's help in easing its refugee crisis. Emre Peker Winds of change in Socialist allies Most people in Cuba cheered the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S. in August after 54 years of Cold War enmity. The surprise thaw has created a wave of visitors from the U.S. for whom Cuba had been a forbidden fruit. Havana-based consultants guide a stream of U.S. business people anxious to enter an undeveloped market just 90 miles from U.S. shores. But despite executive actions lifting limits on remittances sent from the U.S. and granting ferry licenses, and a December agreement to resume regularly scheduled flights next year, few business deals have been announced as most trade and investment is still forbidden by the U.S. In Cuba's ally Venezuela, voters who have endured the world's highest inflation and shortages of basic goods repudiated President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, heir of the populist icon Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, by handing the opposition a sweeping majority in the legislature. Twelve years of populism in Argentina came to an end when Mauricio Macri defeated President Cristina Kirchner. Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff is facing impeachment as she grapples with the worst economic nosedive in a generation. Jos\u00e9 de C\u00f3rdoba Modi's cautious year India became the world's fastest-growing major economy this year\u0097in part because of changes to the way it calculates gross domestic product. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make India an easier place to do business gains. But worries about alienating rural voters prompted a retreat from efforts to ease a strict land-acquisition law, while partisan wrangling delayed his plan for a simplified national sales tax. A big defeat for Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections in Bihar in November helped rally the fragmented opposition\u0097developments that could affect his willingness and ability to advance his economic agenda. In a December speech, Mr. Modi defended his step-by-step approach, saying his government was dismantling hurdles to doing business, making subsidies more efficient rather than eliminating them and improving the management of state enterprises instead of rushing to privatize them. Niharika Mandhana Nepal quake kills nearly 9,000 A magnitude-7.8 earthquake and aftershocks in Nepal killed nearly 9,000 people in April and May, laying waste to hillside villages, triggering a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest and wrecking historic temples in the capital, Kathmandu. But the hardships didn't end there for the small country, Asia's poorest after Afghanistan. At first, the Nepalese government moved quickly to mobilize foreign aid and establish a reconstruction agency. Politicians also united in September, after nearly a decade of discord, to approve a new constitution. But since then, protests by residents of Nepal's southern plains, who say the new constitution puts them at a political disadvantage, have disrupted shipments from India of food, fuel and other supplies. Raymond Zhong Fund probe roils Malaysia Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak faced street protests and calls for his resignation after news broke that government investigators had discovered that nearly $700 million had been transferred into the prime minister's alleged private bank accounts through companies, agencies and banks linked to the troubled state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Bhd. Opponents both in and out of his party, the ruling United Malays National Organization, called on him to resign. Former leader Mahathir Mohamad, who ruled Malaysia for more than two decades, was among Mr. Najib's most vociferous critics. Financial regulators in several countries began investigations into 1MDB's dealings. Throughout the storm, Mr. Najib denied any wrongdoing or using any money for personal gain. 1MDB has denied any wrongdoing and has said it is cooperating with investigators. The country's anticorruption agency stepped in to say that the funds transferred to his alleged account were donations. A Chinese firm bought up some of 1MDB's power assets, easing some of its multibillion-dollar debt. James Hookway World soccer shake-up FIFA, soccer's world governing body, had experienced turmoil before. There were internal investigations and confidential reports that detailed cozy deals on everything from marketing to World Cup hosting rights. But never in its 111-year history had the organization waked up to a scene like the one that unfolded in Zurich's luxury Baur au Lac hotel on May 27, two days before FIFA's presidential election. Around 6 a.m., Swiss plainclothes police walked in with U.S. arrest warrants. They marched out with seven members of FIFA's ruling committee and other executives, escorting them to unmarked cars bound for holding cells. The U.S. indictment alleged \u0093rampant, systemic and deep-rooted corruption totaling hundreds of millions of dollars over two decades. Most of it centered on deals made in Latin America and the Caribbean using U.S. bank accounts and dollars. FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who wasn't named in the indictment, was re-elected to an unprecedented fifth term. But on June 2, with pressure mounting, he announced he would be stepping down as soon as a special election could be organized. The date was set for Feb. 26. The months after the arrests brought more chaos amid modest reform. The three most powerful men in global soccer were cast aside, leaving a vacuum atop the game. FIFA secretary-general J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke was suspended for his role in a ticket-selling scheme. Mr. Blatter was placed under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities and provisionally banned by FIFA. Michel Platini, head of European soccer, was also suspended. All three men have denied wrongdoing. In a separate raid at the Baur au Lac in December, Swiss police arrested more FIFA officials under a second U.S. indictment. By the end of the beautiful game's ugliest year, the U.S. had charged 41 high-ranking soccer officials and executives, convicting 12. Just before Christmas, Messrs. Blatter and Platini were handed eight-year bans from the game by FIFA's Ethics Committee for conflict of interest. Both men said they would appeal. In a long, rambling news conference, Mr. Blatter, 79 years old, struck a defiant tone. \u0093I'll be back, he said. Joshua Robinson Greece accepts a third bailout Supporters called it brave, critics self-destructive. Greece's rebellion against the eurozone and International Monetary Fund captivated the world from January until a late-summer denouement defused, but didn't solve, the long-running debt crisis. Greeks voted the left-wing Syriza party into power to end the austerity measures that Germany and other creditors had imposed in return for loans to stave off outright Greek bankruptcy. Syriza argued that belt-tightening measures since 2010, totaling over 30% of Greece's annual economic output, had deepened a slump while failing to restore financial health. A game of chicken began. Germany told Greece to comply or leave the euro. The Greeks warned that their country's collapse would destabilize Europe. Berlin's threat was more credible. German-led creditors couldn't accept the open challenge to their bailout strategy, and rejected Syriza's alternative: generous debt relief with few strings attached. Much attention was focused on Greece's flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis. But the real protagonist was the inexperienced Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, an inexperienced and unpredictable leader who wavered between confrontation and compromise. In a last-ditch attempt to soften Berlin's stance, he called a July 5 referendum on austerity. A bank run forced him to impose capital controls. Greeks resoundingly voted \u0093no to the creditors' terms. But voters and Mr. Tsipras saw that Greece had overplayed its hand. Unwilling to risk even-worse havoc, Athens agreed to a new, austerity-heavy bailout a week later. The lesson: Greeks feared leaving the euro more than Europe feared losing Greece. Marcus Walker Climate summit ends with a deal The global climate summit in December was geared for success from the start\u0097mainly because it was haunted by a past failure. The last such gathering, in Copenhagen in 2009, collapsed into recriminations. That set back efforts to address climate change for half a decade. Organizers of this year's gathering in Paris came up with a new approach: nearly 200 countries submitted voluntary plans up front for cutting greenhouse gases by ramping up renewables like wind and solar, improving energy efficiency and boosting the use of electric cars. It was the first time all countries, not just developed ones, took responsibility jointly to curb emissions. Only then did they meet\u0097hundreds of delegates, surrounded by tens of thousands of observers, activists, businessmen, scientists and journalists\u0097completing in two weeks of complicated, tumultuous negotiations an agreement that was more ambitious than almost anyone expected. It amounts to an effort to phase out fossil fuels in the second half of this century to keep global temperatures from rising less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), perhaps even only 1.5 degrees. To accomplish that, the deal lays out a binding process of 5-year reviews to take stock and ramp up the effort. That is because, for all the accolades, the sum of the plans still didn't add up to even the 2 degree goal, much less the more ambitious 1.5 degrees. Bill Spindle Cameron gets boost The British political landscape saw a surprise victory for Prime Minister David Cameron in May elections\u0097the first majority for the Conservatives since 1992. The antiausterity Scottish National Party became the third-largest party in the U.K. Parliament despite its failed bid for Scottish secession. The main opposition Labour Party chose Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist, as its new chief. His anti-war and antiausterity message appeals to grass-roots members but has riled many Labour lawmakers, who say his leftist slant will alienate centrist voters they believe the party needs to win back power. While Labour infighting potentially helped Mr. Cameron, his party faces its own divisions, notably on Britain's relationship with the European Union. Mr. Cameron was pushing his partners for changes, particularly on migration policy and access to benefits, before holding a referendum on membership that he has promised British voters.

{"title": "China", "date": "21 December 2015", "body": "Li is soon to be the owner of a A$2 million (HK$11 million) plant in South Australia to process and package local wines and sell them China, where demand for the tipple has taken off. Li is just one of many entrepreneurs who have made money in traditional low-end industries but are now looking to capitalise on greener opportunities farther afield. \u0093We realised that heavy industry in China was moving toward higher standards, we were required to be more environmentally friendly and smart. So we started looking for new projects around the world a couple of years ago, and decided to work with vineyards in Australia,\u0094 Li said. \u0093Many other companies in Tianjin have also recognised the urgency of this and are looking to diversify overseas.\u0094 For Li, Australia was attractive because the country was \u0093politically stable, financially safe\u0094, and offered a community of Chinese immigrants and friends. It also offered a way to feed the growing Chinese appetite for safe, top-quality food and beverages. Chinese investment in Australia has grown substantially to make the island country the second-biggest recipient of aggregated global Chinese direct investment last year, according to a report by KPMG and the University of Sydney's China Studies Centre. Chinese investment in Australia totaled A$8.35 billion in 2014, and for the first time, private sector investment exceeded that by state-owned enterprises in the number of deals as well as in total value, according to the report \u0093Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia\u0094. Agribusiness and food, which did not make the top 10 list of sectors for Chinese M&A investment in 2010, was fifth in terms of deal value last year.?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=intranet&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign But industry insiders say thereare many challenges facing the aspiring investors, many of whom have backgrounds in real estate and other sectors but no experience in agriculture. Tan Jialong, assistant to the chairman of Shanghai-based Zendai Group, said the company, which used to focus on property, thought Australian livestock would be a good investment and was looking for new growth opportunities there. \u0093In the future, in terms of consumer goods and food, China needs imports from all across the globe to meet demand from its consumers. This is an area we find promising,\u0094 Tan said. Zendai and a consortium of private Chinese companies bid for one the world's biggest cattle stations but it application was rejected by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board on the grounds of national interest - part of the holdings is adjacent to a weapons testing area. The failed bid, widely reported in Australia and China, highlights the ongoing media scrutiny and political attention foreign buyers of farmland can face. Zuo Zheng, managing director of Haichuang International, a Tianjin-based consultancy on overseas agribusiness investment, said that for big deals, the authorities' decision may be influenced by public opinion. \u0093Australians are used to a quiet life and they don't like this to change. Too much foreign investment may mean intrusion into their life,\u0094 Zuo said. But most Chinese investors were unlikely to face major official obstacles, \u0093especially when we're only at an initial stage and most investors are small-scale, private businesses\u0094, he said. Another challenge was the different ways of working, said Zuo, who completed doctoral studies in Australia before founding the company last year. \u0093The country is so rich in agricultural resources that farmers often don't care much about productivity and returns, which is quite the opposite in China - Chinese farmers want to make the most out of a parcel of land,\u0094 Zuo said. Geoff Warriner, senior consultant at CBRE Australia, a unit of New York-listed CBRE, agreed there were differences. \u0093A Chinese family business which comes here will be amazed by the vastness of the cattle properties where only 20 people live. It's a big mind change from the normal Chinese way of living,\u0094 Warriner said. He also said that inexperienced Chinese investors might not get the management advice they needed for farming in Australia, where input prices were high, climate patterns unfavorable and market access may be limited. Despite the risks, Chinese were making the biggest foreign investments in Australian agribusiness, Zuo said. Those include a A$47 million outlay on two Australian cattle stations by Zhejiang Tianma, a Zhejiang-based bearing maker listed in Shenzhen. \u0093There's a great opportunity for [Tianma] to continue investing and expanding and building a good business on the back of the Australian livestock industry and ultimately building a supply chain back to China,\u0094 Warriner said. \u0093When talking about agriculture Australia is a very clean, green country with traceability from where an animal is born to where it's butchered and exported,\u0094 he said. For Li, who's building a wine making factory in South Australia, the plan also included migrating with her family. \u0093It's much less crowded, and there is clean air and land,\u0094 she said.

{"title": "China", "date": "21 December 2015", "body": "Investment growth would slow to 9 per cent in 2016 as investment in manufacturing fell and spending on property stagnated, the Economic Daily reported on Sunday, citing the National Development and Reform Commission's economic research institute. Growth in household spending would also slow to single digits as slower income growth made consumers warier, the report said. \u0093China's economy will face big downward pressures next year, and economic growth rate is likely to drop further,\u0094 the report said. GDP growth is forecast to come in at 6.9 per cent this year, the slowest since 1990. The warning comes as top leaders, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, provincial party secretaries and state conglomerate executives, meet in Beijing to discuss ways to arrest a deepening slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. While a Politburo meeting this month listed industrial overcapacity and a glut of residential property as priorities to tackle in 2016, it was not clear how the government would use its fiscal, monetary and industrial policy levers to achieve \u0093reasonable\u0094 growth next year. The country's economic growth prospects were gloomy, with falling industrial profits, deepening factory-gate deflation, worsening overcapacity and growing financial and unemployment risks, the NDRC institute said.?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=intranet&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign \u0093Some hidden unemployment problems will float to the surface to intensify unemployment pressure, and it will be a threat to job stability next year,\u0094 according to the report. While the booming e-commerce sector was creating new jobs such as parcel delivery positions, it was also destroying traditional jobs in retailing, it added. The battle to clear up zombie companies, meanwhile, would be an uphill one due to \u0093all kinds of difficulties\u0094, including local government protectionism, the institute added. The NDRC think tank added its voice to a chorus calling on the government to loosen fiscal spending to offset growth headwinds next year. The authorities should expand fiscal spending, have a high fiscal-GDP ratio, and issue more treasury bonds to raise money for big projects next year, it said. The central bank should continue to cut required deposit reserves and interest rates, and the authorities should continue to allow modest weakening in the yuan to aid exporters, the report said. An annual blue book by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published last week forecast that GDP growth would fall to 6.6-6.8 per cent next year, while a central bank paper said it would be 6.8 per cent. In addition to immediate task of stabilising growth, the leadership has been advocating \u0093supply-side\u0094 changes to put China growth on a sustainable path over the long run. That push includes cutting red tape so that companies can focus more on developing new ideas and products. \u0093We must give more green lights and reduce the number of red lights for businesses so that innovation can be put on a fast track,\u0094 former NDRC vice-chairman Xu Xianping said at a conference on the weekend.

{"title": "Yirendai IPO Could Set Pace", "date": "21 December 2015", "body": "HONG KONG -- One of the last companies to float in the U.S. this year could set a trend for 2016. Chinese peer-to-peer lender Yirendai Ltd. raised $75 million last week in an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, according to people with knowledge of the matter, becoming the first Chinese company of its kind to be publicly traded overseas. Despite its small size, Yirendai's IPO has opened the door to a possible wave of listings from Chinese financial technology, or so-called fintech, companies. Such companies provide financial services with Internet or mobile-based software. The online lender will join the ranks of U.S. counterparts such as LendingClub Corp., the world's largest online credit marketplace, according to its website, and On Deck Capital Inc., which lends to small businesses. Shares of both rose sharply after their IPOs in December last year, but are down more than 50% this year. Still, the popularity of Yirendai's IPO suggests there is strong investor demand for such companies. Its books were covered seven to eight times, with 80% of investors from the U.S., according to one person with knowledge of the matter. It sold 7.5 million shares at $10 each, the midpoint of the indicative range, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Private investment in China's fintech sector has reached $3.5 billion this year, up from 2014's $927 million, data from the Centre for Asia Private Equity Research show. Eventually these people [private investors] would like to exit and IPO is clearly an option, said Maggie Lee, a partner with KPMGChina. The fintech sector is emerging as an investment opportunity just as China's traditional financial services, especially its banking sector, are falling out of favor, thanks mainly to rising credit risks in China's slowing economy. However, new doesn't necessarily mean safe. Problems have emerged in peer-to-peer lending, which remains relatively unregulated compared with traditional lenders. More than 30% of the 3,769 online lending platforms in China had experienced credit issues by the end of November, according to a report jointly published by Chinese peer-to-peer portal Wangdaizhijia and consulting firm Yingcan. Yirendai couldn't be reached for comment. --- Telis Demos and Rick Carew contributed to this article. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "Magazine", "date": "20 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. It's almost impossible to avoid Fan Bingbing in the mainland. Her slender figure is used to promote sportswear on billboards across the country and as the cast for Barbie dolls bearing her name while her snow-white skin, full lips and long raven hair serve the multinational makers of beauty products well. On the big screen she triumphs in many genres while on television she sweeps through sets dressed in the clothes of ancient dynasties. And on the most prestigious catwalks of the world, designers invite her to imbue their creations with elegance. As if all that were not enough, she's ubiquitous on the radio, too, her velvet voice giving life to mellow pop songs. The highest-grossing actress in China has, according to the United States' foremost business magazine, now become the only non-American on the list of the 10 best paid on the planet. Having become an idol of the masses in the emerging superpower, where she boasts 42 million followers on the social network Weibo, her role in last year's X-Men: Days of Future Past helped her earn an estimated US$21 million and rise to fourth position in this year's Forbes rankings. She has become the very definition of success in 21st-century China, summarised in the newly minted expression baifumei: white, rich and beautiful. After throwing herself onto the couch in her suite at the Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai's Pudong district, Fan shows herself to be sincere, candid and friendly, too. She has matched a checked black and red skirt with a simple white shirt, and assures me that she eschews make-up whenever possible. That is why she has asked not to be photographed during our conversation. What she will allow, however, is a free-ranging interview. To the obvious consternation of one of her three assistants, I do not have to follow an agreed script, as has become the norm with Chinese stars. She begins by placing her mobile phone, in a grey furry cover with huge bunny ears attached, face down on the table, the gadget almost continuously vibrating as WeChat messages arrive in quick succession. I got interested in acting when I was 11 or 12, and saw a TV series based on the empress of China [Wu Zetian]', says Fan, in Putonghua. I found her character fascinating, and I promised myself one day I'd incarnate her. Despite being born into a military family in the coastal city of Qingdao, Shandong province - both her grandfather and father were in the navy - her acting talent was allowed to blossom. My father was a singer and my mother a dancer. They both loved the arts, but the Cultural Revolution buried their dreams of a career in that field. They understood how hard to bear that is. So, while parents in China are not like those abroad, where they are often treated as friends, I always had the understanding and support of mine. Fan learned to play the flute and piano as a child and later enrolled in the Xie Jin Film & Television Art College of Shanghai Normal University, making her acting debut at the age of 15. In China, to be successful, it is often not enough to have talent and earn merit. Some guanxi [connections] is almost always necessary. But when I walked into the entertainment industry, my family had no guanxi. So I knew I had to risk failure and bear the consequences alone. However, luck was on her side and it was an unexpected shock for me and my family when, just a year later, in 1997, she found fame in the TV series My Fair Princess. Since then, Fan has starred in about 90 films and soap operas on three continents. She has found commercial success with movies such as Cell Phone, the highest-grossing film in China in 2003, but also won the approval of international critics thanks to Lost in Beijing (2007) and Buddha Mountain (2010), both directed by her friend Li Yu. Furthermore, she has realised her dream of playing Wu, China's only empress. My parents are proud, Fan says, with obvious satisfaction, before modestly adding, My success can be summarised with a Chinese saying that is very international: 'Being in the right place at the right time to do the right thing.' Of course, beauty helps, as it does elsewhere in the world, but looks alone are not enough. It's important to accumulate experience, work hard and love what you do despite the difficulties that may entail. At this stage of her career, she'd be forgiven for slowing down a little, but, at 34, she has recently picked up the pace: in the past two years she has acted in 11 films, appeared in countless advertising campaigns and even taken up the role of a judge on CCTV's new talent show, Amazing Chinese. She has been criticised, however, for the quality of the projects she has been involved in and a lack of consistency in her career. The naysayers claim she veers carelessly from teen comedy to sci-fi movie to social drama and that she's lost her way. Fan smiles. In China, it doesn't matter how well you do things, there will always be someone who criticises you. Li's movies are a case in point. Many accused Fan of being disloyal to the nation for participating in productions that are critical of Chinese society. State censors decided to withdraw Lost in Beijing while it was on its way to a box-office record because of the sex scenes, which included a rape. To prevent the same thing from happening with their next project, the director played it safe, but still the censors forced her to rewrite the script for Buddha Mountain, taking issue with a scene in which a trio of rebellious youngsters - including the character played by Fan - try to derail a train. It isn't the movie I'd like to have made, acknowledged Li, before the premiere, the director being one of the leading exponents of the Sixth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, a group who style themselves as urban and committed to social causes. On the other hand, some critics say Fan is too partial to superficial melodramas such as this year's Ever Since We Love (another with Li at the helm) and goofy comedies such as One Night Surprise (2013), which sees Fan's character try to discover which of three men made her pregnant and is full of slapstick and innuendo. More recently, Fan's version of The Empress of China - with a 300 million yuan (HK$360 million) budget, one of the most expensive TV projects ever undertaken - has attracted controversy. This time, the censors were alarmed by the amount of cleavage on show, including that of the leading lady. The production company, the actress' own Fan Bingbing Studio, tried to justify the 3,000 costumes used in the 96-episode series by pointing to their authenticity - that was what was worn during the Tang dynasty (618-907) - but to no avail. Scenes in which women are seen from the front had to be re-edited, to hide their busts. Although most commentators mocked the government's puritanism, Fan did not escape unscathed. In many cases, those who criticise me want to put themselves in the limelight. I think it's very different from what is done abroad, where flattery is more usual, she says. In recent years, Fan has been able to compare first-hand the differences between the film industries in China, Hollywood and Europe - in 2011, she acted in French drama Stretch. I found that in my country it's harder. Ours is a profession that is not protected in China, and it requires great sacrifice. Often we work 24 hours straight, and we can't rest either physically or mentally. Furthermore, the pressure from incessant rumours in the media is exhausting. In Europe there is a lot of freedom, independent films succeed and you can breathe in an atmosphere of great inspiration. It's similar to what happens in South Korea. In Hollywood, on the other hand, I felt that there was greater professionalism, and everything is prepared to make the actors' work as smooth as possible. Fan was the first Asian hired to star in the X-Men saga. However, she is aware that she wasn't chosen primarily for her acting talent. The strong economic growth that China is undergoing makes many American productions want to try to win over the public by including elements of our culture, she says, imitating the sound of money with a sharp ding. In the case of X-Men, they needed a Chinese face. Director Bryan Singer had seen some of my films - I guess he liked my work - and when we met at the Oscars, we closed the deal in less than an hour. It was quick and simple; very straightforward. The makers of the Chinese version of Iron Man 3 took this idea further, adding scenes shot in China and featuring Fan to the original movie to increase its appeal in the country and to facilitate the placement of products made by mainland companies with generous budgets. Many laughed at the shoddy way in which the new scenes were introduced, but it's obvious the commercial interests of Hollywood in China provide an opportunity for home-grown stars to reach out to the rest of the world. Still we must be calm and careful with our choices, Fan warns. Although the worldwide audience may end up knowing me for these blockbusters, of course I'm aware that maybe I'll never be given a leading role in Hollywood and that most of my audience will always be in China. It's a great experience that I can learn a lot from but I'm not going to lose perspective, she says, fiddling with her two diamond bracelets. On the plus side, Fan believes, considerable opportunities are opening up in China. We are copying the American model, with a lot of money invested in some movies. The technical skills and resources are world class. The problem is that many investors have no idea what the movie industry is, so there are many bad stories and the market has not yet matured. Maybe that's also the reason why our films don't succeed abroad. And that's why she decided to establish the Fan Bingbing Studio. As an actress, I always participate in films that offer me an interesting role, regardless of what I get paid. As a producer, I delegate financial matters and focus on the creative side, looking to offer something different to the audience. I prefer social films. Li Yu's movies are a good example. They focus on real people with real problems. They are believable stories, but I'm afraid that isn't what the Chinese public wants to see. On one hand, because they tend to have low budgets and the audience has grown accustomed to large productions. On the other hand, because the Chinese are under great pressure, with large work loads and family, and prefer stories that let them escape and have a good time. That's why comedies or kung fu movies have so much punch among the Chinese. However, the audience is evolving, and the independent market is growing. I am convinced that, in the future, the quality of Chinese movies will be much higher. In any case, it is Fan's international profile that makes many think of her as the female face of Chinese pop culture, ahead of compatriots Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi. Fan's appearance at a new Adidas store in Shanghai the morning after our interview offers a good example of her standing. Accompanied by myriad bodyguards, she cannot roam the store. Even before the mall opens, workers have gathered to squint at her from a distance, phone cameras at the ready. She's a goddess, an overexcited teenager tells a friend. She still looks great in person, her chin is so slim, the other agrees. Not much attention is paid to Fan's boyfriend, actor Li Chen, who is polishing his look in one of the shop's mirrors. He may be a star - having acted in movies such as Assembly (2006) and Aftershock (2009), as well as The Empress of China - but she's the big draw. And, when the barrier is lifted at 9.30am, security guards have a hard time holding back her fans. A few have been selected to have their merchandise handed to them by the golden couple and some leave in grateful tears. Fan indulges everybody with a warm smile. EVERY GENERATION HAS AN actor who served as ambassador to the world, says Fan, in her hotel suite. It's an honour for me to be granted that role, which I feel is because I've had a lot of international work lately. China is growing and gaining power, and I am glad that the world is paying more and more attention to us. Perhaps, to achieve global conquest, all Fan needs to do now is polish her English. The language barrier is a headache for me, she concedes. But I'm too busy to study. I have a tutor, but she hasn't had the chance to give me a lesson in six months. What Fan does say in English, though, is Goodbye. Fan's boyfriend, actor Li Chen.; Above: Fan Bingbing at the opening of an Adidas store in Shanghai.

Despite finally getting a bigger say, the emerging economic powers are going their own ways In a changing world, governance of the International Monetary Fund, the lender of last resort, needed modernising. Leaders of the Group of 20 agreed in 2010 that individual IMF quotas and voting rights needed to better reflect its members' standing in the world economy. That meant reducing the role of advanced European countries and Gulf states, and increasing that of emerging nations, particularly China. The US wanted to safeguard its standing as the fund's dominant voice; doubling all quotas would achieve that. IMF critics in Congress, however, opposed the fund's decision to lend to Greece despite grave doubts about its repayment abilities. The IMF had invoked a rule that allowed such lending if a failing country threatened international contagion. To US conservatives, that wasn't their problem; US financial institutions had much less exposure to toxic Greek assets than European ones did. Those US objections make little sense now. Greece's latest bailout has proceeded without IMF participation: the fund still doubts that the country can repay its debt, but Greece no longer poses a systemic risk. The European Union turned out to be rich enough to fund Greece's 85 billion euro (HK$714 billion) rescue package. Besides, a political deal has been struck: the appropriations bill calls on the US representative to the IMF to use his voting power for the repeal of the systemic exception, which allowed IMF participation in Greece's previous bailout. So the long-delayed rearrangement - which former IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn called the most important reform in the governance of the institution since its creation - should now go smoothly. It'll be useful to bailout recipients; the doubled quotas will make it easier for the IMF to lend them more, on shorter notice and under more flexible requirements. Yet the changes are probably too little, too late by now. For one thing, the new distribution of voting shares still doesn't do justice to China. Though the US, too, has a smaller say than its share of the world economy warrants, the gap between China's economic might and its IMF influence is bigger. The power redistribution will, no doubt, please China - an added bonus after the IMF decision to designate the yuan as a reserve currency next year - but it won't deter Beijing from building alternative institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. China, huge as it is, cannot afford to put all its eggs in the US-dominated basket. Nor can other big emerging nations, such as India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa. They, with China, have already set up an IMF alternative - the so-called New Development Bank. It's not going to be particularly important in the coming years, given the economic weakening of Russia and Brazil. Still, the desire for a lending pool independent of the West isn't going away. Europeans, for their part, are also creating their own emergency infrastructure. Advance notice that their role at the IMF would shrink highlighted that their needs in a serious crisis would exceed the fund's ability to help. The US, the only member that has the votes to block major changes in how the IMF operates, has diminished its ability to influence events. The United States is no longer seen as a reliable negotiating partner on IMF issues. The terms of US consent to the 2010 reform - including a requirement for the US representative to ask permission at home before voting to approve any large-scale programme - appear to signal a US desire to steer the IMF back toward its origins. That makes the IMF less interesting to the emerging nations; and their empowerment by the proposed reforms won't resolve the conflict.Bloomberg "}

Relaxation in home-buying rules, easing liquidity and interest rate reductions contribute to growing price momentum in lower-ranked cities More mainland Chinese cities saw home prices rise and growth widen last month, spurred by a relaxation of home-buying restrictions, easing liquidity and a string of interest-rate cuts over the past few months. The price momentum is still on an upswing mode. More tier- two and tier-three cities would report positive month-on-month price growth in 2016. We expect the recovery in 2016 would come more from the price front rather than volume, said Alan Jin, a property analyst at Mizuho Securities. Land prices in tier-one cities are indeed too expensive, as developers flocked into leading cities deemed as a safe haven, he said. However, Jin said land prices in lower-tier cities have not moved that much. The price of a new home prices rose in 33 cities, compared with 27 in October, the National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Prices dropped in 27 cities, fewer than the 33 cities in Octo-ber, and were unchanged in 10 cities. A similar picture unfolded in second-hand home prices, with 40 cities reporting a rise in November, against 38 in October. Prices fell in 16, compared to 23 in October, and were unchanged in 14. Average new home prices rose 0.9 per cent in November from a year earlier, according to Reuters , which calculated its figures from bureau data, extending October's 0.1 per cent rise. The recovery is being helped by the central government's five interest-rate cuts since November last year and an easing of home-purchase restrictions in a move to simulate the slowing economy. Economic growth in the world's second largest economy is expected to ease to 6.8 per cent next year from an expected 6.9 per cent this year, the People's Bank of China said in a working paper published on Wednesday. Twenty-one cities saw year-on-year new price rises, against 16 in October, while 49 posted declines. The best performer was Shenzhen, which saw new home price growth of 2.9 per cent month on month. On a year-on-year basis, prices leapt 44.6 per cent. The worst performer was Jinzhou in Liaoning province, which saw home prices decline 0.6 per cent month on month and a drop of 5.3 per cent year on year. Beijing rose 1 per cent month on month and 9.6 per cent on the year. Shanghai rose 1.9 per cent on month and 15.4 per cent on year. Guangzhou rose 0.6 per cent month on month and 8.2 per cent on year. The slowing economy is certainly a hidden risk, which is also intertwined with the weak investment from the property sector. That's why government is so keen to hasten the inventory clearance cycle as evidenced by the various easing policies, Jin said. China Resources Land, which had bought a number of sites earlier this year, raised concerns over the rising land prices in mainland cities. We tried to bid on some sites such as one in Wuhan, but failed, said James Yu Jian, executive director and chief financial officer of China Resources Land. The easing credit conditions is helping to bring more bidders into competition for sites, lifting land prices to levels that seem out of synch with fundamentals. It may not be healthy to the market, Yu said. "}
{"title": "How U.S. Interest Rates Influence the World Economy", "date": "18 December 2015", "body": "After keeping financial markets in suspense for months, the U.S. Federal Reserve finally acted on Wednesday by raising its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Financial markets world-wide, including in Asia, not only took the move in stride but were buoyed by it. After all, the move was widely anticipated, signaled the Fed's confidence in the durability of the U.S. economic recovery and came with the assurance that U.S. monetary policy would remain accommodative. Yet there are reasons to worry about the fallout. It's not because the Fed's action is likely to cause any emerging-market economies to tip over into balance of payments or currency crises. Most of these economies now have lower external-debt levels compared to the levels they experienced prior to past crises. Many also have more flexible exchange rates, which act as shock absorbers, and larger stashes of foreign-exchange reserves than they did in the past. The Fed's action is a net positive for emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere. It erases some uncertainty that had added to short-term volatility in capital flows and currencies, and cushions the blow with a dovish statement about future rate hikes. But for all its power and influence, the Fed isn't the only central bank that matters. While the Fed's move removes one source of short-term uncertainty, it highlights the stark divergence in business-cycle conditions and monetary policies between the U.S. and virtually every other major advanced and emerging-market economy. This portends further volatility in global currency markets and international capital flows, which could have whiplash effects for countries exposed to these crosswinds. The Fed's move is likely to be welcomed by central banks in other advanced economies, particularly the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are eager to weaken their currencies in order to boost their flagging economies and push up domestic inflation. This will exacerbate the asymmetry in global exchange rates, leading to further and more persistent strength in the U.S. dollar relative to every other major currency. Concerns about a massive pullback of capital from emerging markets are probably overblown. After all, this was just a quarter percent hike in U.S. short-term interest rates. Once the dust settles, the Fed's action alone is unlikely to cause major portfolio rebalancing among international investors. However, this rate hike reminds emerging-market economies with weak fundamentals that their room for maneuvering has been reduced even more, leaving them with little choice but to push through essential reforms. A surging dollar could create macroeconomic stress in countries that have accumulated high levels of dollar-denominated corporate debt. And it will certainly add to the difficulties that economies such as Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Venezuela are already facing as a result of economic mismanagement, weak commodity prices and political instability. Among the Asian emerging market economies, India is well positioned to weather the effects of the Fed rate hike. Its economy still has growth momentum and room to tolerate some currency depreciation without adverse domestic consequences. What will the Fed's actions do to China? Last week, the People's Bank of China signaled that it was preparing to put into practice what it has been doing in principle since its currency was depegged from the dollar in 2005: manage the yuan's value against a basket of currencies. In reality, the yuan has remained tightly managed relative to the dollar. This has created complications for domestic macroeconomic management as the dollar strengthened against other currencies over the past year, lifting along the yuan, even while the Chinese economy was losing momentum. Managing the yuan's value relative to a basket of currencies rather than just the U.S. dollar makes good economic sense and would allow China a smoother transition to a more market-determined exchange rate. It would also provide cover for the PBOC to orchestrate an orderly depreciation of the yuan without spooking markets by appearing to devalue the currency to prop up growth. The risk is that domestic and foreign investors may not buy this, since they still lack confidence in the Chinese government's economic management. This could trigger another wave of capital outflows, adding to instability in the region. For China and other emerging market economies, the right response isn't to recalibrate monetary policy or instituting capital controls to fend off volatility. Rather, it is to rebuild confidence by delivering on financial-market reforms to improve resource allocation, as well as implementing supply-side reforms to boost productivity and promote more balanced growth. The Fed's action warns policy makers in these countries that time is short. Now that the Fed has acted, attention will quickly turn to the next pressing question: What will China do?

{"title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)", "date": "18 December 2015", "body": "Asian markets took their cue Thursday from the U.S. and welcomed the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter percentage point rate increase. The \"sell on the rumor, buy on the news\" reaction isn't surprising. Over the past two years currency and debt markets have gradually priced in Fed liftoff. If the world's main reserve currency does return to normalcy, that should be reassuring. But there may be more pain ahead for emerging markets if U.S. rates rise by a full percentage point over the next year. In 1994 a rapid tightening caused a painful correction in the developed world's bond markets. It also started a chain reaction that led to the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Asian countries had informally pegged their currencies to the dollar and encouraged banks and companies to borrow in dollars. But as U.S. interest rates rose, ill-advised projects undertaken in the boom years came under stress. Businesses screamed for relief and the International Monetary Fund prescribed devaluation. That caused a full-fledged crisis as foreign debts became harder to pay and tighter monetary policy was needed to stabilize currencies and rein in inflation. Today the situation is different. Exchange rates are more flexible, which encourages hedging. Most Asian countries have built up their foreign reserves and borrowing in U.S. dollars is less prevalent. Over the past two years since the taper tantrum in May 2013, many companies have prepared for higher rates by reducing foreign debt. But as the Mark Twain line has it, history may not repeat itself but it does rhyme. The flood of dollars from the Fed's quantitative easing had a profound effect on Asian countries despite their efforts to avoid past mistakes. After 2010, dollars borrowed at near-zero rates migrated to emerging markets because their growth prospects and asset yields were attractive. Asian central banks sought to prevent their currencies from rising by lowering rates and buying dollars. The spread between the rates paid by blue chip and riskier borrowers narrowed. The result was a boom financed with local-currency debt. From 2008 until last year, the ratio of bank credit-to-GDP increased across Asia, especially in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. Bond markets have taken off in some countries, while in others shadow-banking institutions have expanded credit without regulatory oversight. Rapid increases in borrowing are often followed by the emergence of bad loans. As U.S. rates rise, some Asian central banks will have to follow. Lower commodity prices and a slowing Chinese economy are already causing stress, and a return to a more normal credit spread would especially hurt the most vulnerable companies. If the contraction in credit leads to nonperforming loans, investors could start to lose confidence and pull their money out. That would force the central banks to raise rates further to defend their currencies, starting a vicious cycle. A more hopeful scenario is that this deleveraging cycle will be gentle. Plentiful reserves and the fact that lending is denominated in local currencies mean that Asian countries should be able to work out any bad debt problems on their own. Even with a low-growth hangover from the credit boom, Asia could remain one of the world's better-performing regions. Nevertheless, the risks created by the Fed's quantitative easing are a reminder that the post-Bretton Woods system remains inherently unstable. Floating exchange rates may be safer than the informally pegged rates of pre-1997 Asia, but they are far more dangerous than the fixed rates that prevailed before 1971. The damage of overshooting markets is compounded by the Fed's scant concern for the global consequences of its actions. The world will remain vulnerable to the aftershocks of the Fed's monetary experiment for years to come. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

Wealth managers are setting their sights on the country's older women with a lifetime of savings to invest Win the hearts of China's damas - the country's middle-aged and elderly women - and you'll be well on your way to winning the China market. Affluent and with plenty of spare cash to invest, damas started making headlines after they rushed to buy gold in 2013, helping global gold prices stabilise from a sharp sell-off. Now these women, who generally possess limited financial knowledge, are being pursued by wealth managers and property agents as they eye China's promising silver-hair market. People aged above 60 will make up 39 per cent of China's population by 2050, compared with the present 15 per cent, according to official data.READ MORE: The dancing damas: China's 'square dancers' take society by storm Damas are often seen in stock bourses, banks and property agencies as they go about their investment decisions in much the same way as they buy clothes and food at malls and markets. I have held shares of many enterprises, though I don't understand their business, said Yu Liping, a 58-year-old retired woman in Ganzhou (??), Jiangxi (??)province. My investments are all recommended by my friends and I believe in group psychology, which means something bought by many people is a must-buy. Yu said all her friends and relatives her age invested. Only the very elderly would leave their money in the bank, she said. But in China, there are very few investment options, and if others say a financial product is good, I will also regard it as good and join the buyer's cohort, she said. Yu followed her friends in buying shares of a Hunan (??)-based bamboo fibre manufacturer in August last year and is looking forward to the company's Australia listing next year. But even as she enthusiastically shared details of that 150,000 yuan (HK$179,700) investment, Yu also related the woeful tale of having put 100,000 yuan earlier this year into Shenzhen Anzi Group, which was collecting funds from the public to launch its online shopping centre. The Southern Metropolis News reported in July that the group was conducting illegal fund-raising and its founder was under investigation. Yu has not received her money back from the investment. Yu also recalled putting 380,000 yuan into shares when the stock market was bullish last year. The stocks' paper value had since shrunk to just 80,000 yuan, she said. The dama attributed her investment failures to new technologies and concepts such as peer-to-peer financing, trust products and crowdfunding. I don't really know how to use the internet well, she said. Even so, Yu and her counterparts are considered financial firms' VIPs, with wealth managers sparing no effort to forge good ties with them. Damas usually have a large amount of idle money after having saved most of their lives. In most families, women are the financial controllers, said Ivan Li, a wealth manager who used to work at a China Merchants Bank branch in Shanghai's Huangpu district. After retiring, these women are free all day and are more willing to invest than young people who are always busy with their work, Li said. The wealth manager said that at least half of his 400 clients were damas and the average amount of assets each dama put in his bank came to about half a million yuan. In dealing with this group of clients, sales workers relied more on their selling skills than on professional knowledge, he said. Last year, the Beijing Evening News reported that a young Pingan Bank accounts manager joined dozens of damas in dancing at a public square in Beijing every evening as a business development tactic. Because damas have little knowledge of financial products, sales people should be patient enough to answer their trivial questions, Li said. Some aunties spent two to three hours in front of our banks, inquring about our products and chatting with us. Xu Jinping, general manager for Fu Hua Asset's eastern China region, said a good sales attitude was a key factor in many damas' investment decisions. The latest Standard & Poor's Ratings Services Global Financial Literacy Survey found that 63 per cent of mainland adults who owned a credit card were financially illiterate. The poll measures a person's financial literacy based on his or her understanding of concepts such as risk diversification, inflation and compound interest. More than 70 per cent of adults in Asia did not adequately understand these key monetary ideas - higher than the world average of 66 per cent - according to the global survey. In the future, there will be fewer such elderly women who like to invest but are financially illiterate, Xu said. The market teaches them lessons and people will become more educated in wealth management. "}

Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland's largest securities company are trading near book value Despite management turmoil and a credit rating downgrade, Citic Securities may offer an attractive opportunity for investors, as a low valuation and strong business fundamentals support a recovery in the stock price going forward, according to analysts. China's largest securities firm has seen close to a dozen executives detained or arrested since August, including its general manager Chen Boming, as Beijing widens its probe into insider trading on the heels of the stock market crash this summer. Last month, chairman Wang Dongming also said he would step down after the next board election, with media reports saying he was forced out for failing to properly supervise his underlings. In late November, Citic Securities said in a filing that the country's top watchdog had started an investigation into the company for alleged violations of securities regulations, without providing further details. Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Tuesday lowered Citic Securities' long-term issuer credit rating to BBB from BBB+ and said it would monitor the company for further downgrades in the future. S&P cited the unexpected management reshuffle and heightened industry risk as concerns. Shares of Citic have tumbled 45 per cent in Shanghai and 40 per cent in Hong Kong so far this year. However, some analysts said the sell-off may be an opportunity for brave investors. We reaffirm our buy rating, said Bank of China International (BOC) analysts in a recent research note, citing Citic's depressed share price and strong business fundamentals. BOC analysts also said it was unlikely that more of its managers would go missing or face investigations in the near future. In mid-November Citic announced the appointment of Zhang Youjun as its next chairman to succeed Wang, suggesting the management shifts since August are coming to an end. On a forward price-to-book ratio Citic's stock looks attractive. The Hong Kong-listed shares trade at a level equal to the company's book value, while its Shanghai-listed shares trade at a slightly more expensive 1.2 times book value. We believe the current valuation level presents low downside risk, BOC said. In addition, the firm has seen a recovery in its brokerage and margin finance businesses, thanks to improving sentiment among Chinese equity investors. Citic's brokerage trading volume surged 46 per cent month on month in November, benefitting from a strong recovery in market turnover. Its margin lending balance jumped 17 per cent in November from the previous month, returning it to the top position among Chinese brokers. However, BOC International also cautioned of potential risks, including unexpected market volatility and regulatory risks of irregular activities by Citic. BOC has a buy on the shares, with a Shanghai share price target of 21.33 yuan and a Hong Kong share price target of HK$22.62. Meanwhile, Daiwa Capital maintained its outperform rating for Citic's Hong Kong shares with a price target of HK$21. Daiwa added that its expects the brokerage to be restructured as a result of the turmoil. The revamp could increase Citic Group's control in the securities firm. Other outcomes include a consolidation of Citic and China Securities, or a regulator-driven takeover by another securities firm, Daiwa analysts said. Regardless of whichever scenario unfolds, Citic shareholders are unlikely to face major downside, Daiwa said. "}

Selling non-performing loans via Taobao to the highest bidder may help banks and the so-called 'bad banks' digest more of the bad debt supply Taobao, China's biggest online shopping platform, is hawking a bit more than Korean cosmetics and Hello Kitty socks these days. The site, owned by Alibaba Group, has become China's premier venue for selling toxic assets directly to anyone looking for claim on bad debt from a make-up factory in Jiangsu province or a drug factory in Zhejiang. China Huarong Asset Management, which went public in Hong Kong last month and is one of four state-backed bad banks, said this week that it plans to sell off 51.5 billion yuan (HK$61.7 billion) worth of bad debt via Taobao. The bad loans, bought off Chinese banks in Zhejiang and Jiangsu, would be sold across mainland China.READ MORE: Bad-debt investment products present new risks in China China Cinda Asset Management, another state-controlled bad-debt manager, was the first firm to sell distressed debt on Taobao's auction platform. In March, the Zhejiang branch of the company sold off two bad debt contracts on a Taobao page for a total 24.5 million yuan. The two contracts sold in eight hours, after garnering a combined 7,978 views. The company said in May that it would sell 4 billion yuan on the platform. An auction manager at the time told the South China Morning Post that Cinda was positioning to make the platform a long-termsolution for bringing to the market the huge amount of bad debt accumulating in China's banking system. A manager for a current Cinda bad-debt sale said yesterday he could not comment on the deal. At the time of reporting, the clock was ticking for bids on bad debt connected to a Jiangsu cosmetics factory. Taobao's financial asset disposal platform has its roots in a judiciary assets disposal programme set up in 2012 to sell off seized assets, according to research from a global financial services firm. A year ago, China Merchant Bank and China Minsheng Bank listed collateral for loans on the Taobao platform but the auctions failed due to low demand. However, commercial banks were only allowed to sell the collateral for assets, not bad debt. Sales of non-performing-loan (NPL) portfolios, which can come at a sharp discount, have been reserved for state asset managers. Those auctions have garnered far more attention - not only because of the strong demand for the assets but also due to questions on the viability of the platform for pawning off China's bad debt. A report from China Orient Asset Management, issued last month, said it expected China's non-performing loan ratio to continue to rise for the next four to six quarters. Four central asset managers were set up by the central government in 1999 to directly unload sour debt from China's four state commercial banks. Over the past two years, more than 20 banks have entered the market, hoping to sell off bad debt only to find tepid demand from asset managers, which have become diversified investment banks. Selling NPLs online to the highest bidder may help the banks and the so-called bad banks digest more of the supply of the bad debt. However, Taobao has yet to answer questions on the need for licensing to operate such a platform. The company did not respond to questions on whether it needed an auction licence, which is standard for offline sale of NPLs. Industry sources have reported Taobao as saying it is a platform for auctioning assets but does not conduct the auctions itself, and therefore does not need a licence. "}

China is big enough to stick to its own agenda when further opening up the capital account, but pace will be subject to global rebalancing , analysts say Holding the world's biggest foreign reserves, an enormous domestic market fuelled by sharply rising consumption demand, Beijing has a huge say when to open its capital account. But the pace for further movements will still be subject to how the global financial markets rebalance, especially after the US Fed announced on Wednesday its first rate hike in almost a decade. The Fed decided to raise rates by 25 basis points overnight in its first rate increase since 2006, while its statement indicated gradual increases will come along as the US economy strengthens further. As you can tell from the process of China joining the [IMF's Special Drawing Rights currency basket], China is highly competent in sticking to its own agenda when engaging in the global market, compared to decades ago when it applied for membership in the WTO, said Li-Gang Liu, China economist at ANZ Bank. It was a contentious evaluation, and analysts argue about whether yuan is qualified for membership, given the currency is neither fully convertible, nor free floating. I would not doubt policy makers' willingness to enhance renminbi's convertibility and opening up more capital account items, said Helen Qiao, greater China chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. However, considering market reactions, especially after the central bank adjusted the exchange rate mechanism and the general instability of the global financial markets, the whole process could potentially drag on, and the capital account liberalisation process may also be pushed back in 2016, Qiao noted. With the view that the US Fed was going to increase rates earlier in the year, the PBOC devalued the yuan by almost 2 per cent on August 11 by raising the official mid price, which took the market by surprise. Beijing later explained the move as a way to relax controls on the exchange rate. The move was also largely taken by analysts as an official recognition of the yuan devaluation, as the US dollar picked up strong momentum afterward. China's foreign-exchange reserves declined last month to their lowest level since February 2013 amid heavy capital outflows, and as the central bank sold dollars to prevent a further steep drop in the yuan. The currency hoard dropped by US$87.2 billion to US$3.44 trillion at the end of November, from US$3.53 trillion a month earlier, according to People's Bank of China data released in early December. During his speech in Washington at an IMF meeting this April, PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan pledged to launch two schemes in 2015 that would free currently inconvertible items under the capital account - one was QDII 2 to allow cross-border investment by individuals; the other was the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect to enable international investors to trade in the domestic stock market. Neither of the two schemes has yet started. Li Yimin, an economist with Shenwan Hongyuan Securities in Beijing, said the delays are due to internal and external uncertainties. The authorities' concerns are that the Shenzhen connect may be embarrassed by low participation, particularly after the stock market rout in summer. As for QDII2, they might be waiting for a better launch time, to buffer the capital outflow pressure triggered by the Fed's rate hike. Once things stabilise, the schemes will kick off quickly, he said. China's capital markets will be much more accessible by the year 2020, as the commitment to further open up capital accounts is irreversible after China joined the SDR, said Liu of ANZ. This July, China had opened its US$5.7 trillion interbank bond market to foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds. Liu said China should consider introducing more long-term funds to the market, for instance, allowing the US$36 trillion worth of global pension funds access to the bond market. The year 2020 will be crucial as China is due to complete it 13th five-year plan by then, and celebrate the 100th founding anniversary for the ruling Communist Party the next year. However, it is worth noting that the concept of capital account convertibility held by the Chinese leadership is different from others. During his speech in Washington in April, Zhou said the capital account convertibility China has targeted is not based on the traditional concept of being fully or freely convertible. Instead, drawing lessons from the global financial crisis, China will adopt a concept of managed convertibility, by using macroprudential measures to limit risks from cross-border capital flows and to maintain the stable value of the currency and a safe financial environment.

Only the very old people, like those in their 80s, would leave their money in the bank, she said. \u0093But in China, there are very few investment options, and if others say a financial product is good, I will also regard it as good and join the buyer's cohort,\u0094 she said. Yu followed her friends in buying shares of a Hunan-based bamboo fibre manufacturer in August last year and is looking forward to the company's Australia listing next year. But even as she enthusiastically shared details of that 150,000 yuan investment, Yu also related the woeful tale of having put 100,000 yuan earlier this year into Shenzhen Anzi Group, which was collecting funds from the public to launch its online shopping centre. The group was in July exposed by the Southern Metropolis News for conducting illegal fund-raising and its founder was put under police investigation. Yu has not received her money back from the investment.?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=intranet&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign Yu also recalled putting 380,000 yuan into shares when the stock market was bullish last year. The stocks' paper value had since shrunk to just 80,000 yuan, she said The dama attributed her investment failures to new technologies and concepts such as peer-to-peer financing, trust products and crowdfunding. \u0093I don't really know how to use the internet well,\u0094 she said. Even so, Yu and her counterparts are considered financial firms' VIPs, with wealth managers sparing no effort in maintaining good relations with them. \u0093Dama usually have a large amount of idle money after having saved throughout most of their lives. In a majority of families, women are the financial controllers,\u0094 said Ivan Li, a wealth manager who used to work at a China Merchants Bank branch in Shanghai's Huangpu district. \u0093After retiring, these women are free all day and are more willing to invest than young people who are always busy with their work,\u0094 Li said. The wealth manager said at least half of his 400 clients were damas and that the average amount of assets each dama put in his bank came up to half a million yuan. In dealing with this group of clients, sales workers relied more on their \u0093selling skills\u0094 than on professional knowledge, he said. Last year, the Beijing Evening News reported that a young Pingan Bank accounts manager joined dozens of damas in dancing at a public square in Beijing every evening as a business development tactic. \u0093Because damas have little knowledge of financial products, sales people should be patient enough to answer their trivial questions,\u0094 Li said. \u0093Some aunties spent two to three hours in front of our banks, inquring about our products and chatting with us.\u0094 Xu Jinping, general manager for Fu Hua Asset's eastern China region, said good sales attitude was an important factor behind many damas' investment decisions. The latest Standard & Poor's Ratings Services Global Financial Literacy Survey found that 63 per cent of Chinese adults who owned a credit card were financially illiterate. The poll measures a person's financial literacy based on his or her understanding of concepts such as risk diversification, inflation and compound interest. More than 70 per cent of adults in Asia did not adequately understand these key monetary ideas - higher than the world average of 66 per cent - according to the survey. \u0093In future, there will be fewer such elderly women who like to invest but are financially illiterate,\u0094 Xu said. \u0093The market teaches them lessons and people will become more educated in wealth management.\u0094 To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here "}
{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "17 December 2015", "body": "Not All Junk Bonds Are Equal The U.S. high-yield bond market has come to represent the sum of all fears for investors. A combination of misallocated capital, restricted liquidity and declining commodities has hit returns. But the state of the market is more nuanced. December has made an already rough year much worse, although Tuesday brought some relief. At the end of November, U.S. junk bonds had lost 2% this year, according to Barclays index data; by Tuesday's close, the market was down 5%. The energy and metals-and-mining sectors are bearing the brunt, down 21.2% and 24.4%, respectively. Other sectors are doing much better. Consumer cyclical bonds remain in positive territory, up 0.6%; noncyclical consumer bonds are up 0.9%.Unfortunately for the high-yield market as a whole, energy and mining companies carry a big weight. The swing in oil prices to a seven-year low and the decline in other commodities is driving divergence in the market. It is pushing up risk premiums across the board. That will hit both stronger and weaker companies. But it also is affecting the distribution of risk. Lower oil and commodity prices should be helpful for consumers, although the effect may take time to be felt. That is why consumer-facing companies are holding up well. The high-yield market as a whole isn't in meltdown. Indeed, the market has done what it has always done: provide capital to riskier companies and then sort the winners from the losers. The extended period of ultralow interest rates encouraged companies to lever up and investors to take risk. The inevitable result is that capital has been misallocated. The biggest damage is in the riskiest credits. While double-B bonds have lost 1.6%, single-B bonds are down 5.3% and triple-C, 12.7%. The problem layered on top of that, however, is more complex: constraints around liquidity, in part due to regulation aimed at making the financial system safer, in part due tofund structures with a built-in liquidity mismatch. The risk is that funds facing pressure may be tempted to sell what is easiest -- which is likely to be better-performing bonds -- rather than the market laggards they really need to get rid of. For other investors, that offers a potential opportunity. The twists and turns of the high-yield market now need to be watched closely. If higher-rated, stronger companies from sectors outside the oil and commodities complex were to face difficulty in raising cash, then the risk is of a wider credit crunch. At least not many companies try to do so in the rest of December. January will be the test. -- Richard Barley Plugging Holes Should Lift Noble After 10 months under siege, Noble Group may finally be striking back. The Singapore-listed commodities trader is in talks to sell its 49% stake in its agricultural arm, called Noble Agri, to China's state-run Cofco. Cofco already leads a consortium that owns the other 51% of Noble Agri. If the deal goes through, kudos to Noble's management. The sales price isn't final, though it is likely to be at least $700 million and may go up to $1 billion, depending on details of the deal. The lower end of the range is higher than the $655 million in short-term debt Noble needs to pay back, given its accessible cash and available bank lines, and assuming it liquidates 20% of its inventories of oil or coal. The higher end is also greater than the $989 million Noble would need without having to sell down inventories. The deal then plugs a very leaky ship. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's highlighted liquidity worries when, last month, they said they would review Noble's ratings for a downgrade to junk. Expect the agencies to then keep their fingers off the downgrade button. That said, Noble's longer-term credit problems aren't completely solved. The company isn't generating cash from operations sustainably. That is one reason funds from operations -- akin to operating cash flow -- stood at 19.8% of total debt in September. This is a key metric that S&P says it wants Noble to boost to 25%. To meet that target, Noble has to improve funds from operations or pay down $1.13 billion of debt. Given the wide range of proceeds from the Noble Agri sale, it may still fall short. If Noble can sell other assets or raise equity, it can safely see itself through. Noble shares, down more than 60% this year, jumped 7.7% Wednesday. For a more sustained rebound, investors will want to see all of Noble's debt difficulties fully resolved. -- Abheek Bhattacharya As Oil Falls, China Keeps Prices High It isn't every day that Big Oil benefits from environmentalism, as China's state-run oil refining giant did Wednesday. But what looks like a boon today may turn into a bane in the future. The Hong Kong shares of China Petroleum & Chemical, better known as Sinopec, jumped 10% on the news that China's top planning body would freeze local gasoline and diesel prices indefinitely. Officials are afraid that as crude oil falls, the cheaper gasoline and diesel is encouraging wanton consumption and causing more pollution. Sinopec and other state refiners such as PetroChina have reason to be pleased as long as the crude they buy or extract is cheaper than the fixed price of gasoline and diesel they sell: They get to keep the difference as profit. Though officials will likely want them to reinvest those profits to upgrade to cleaner-burning fuels. Beijing's price fix could essentially cap growth in demand for gasoline and diesel. That is bad news for Chinese oil demand. China never let the full impact of cheaper crude pass on to Chinese consumers, thanks to taxes on gasoline plus some regulatory interference, but some of it at least filtered through. Since July 2014, Chinese gasoline has become 29% cheaper, compared with 66% for Brent crude, says Sanford C. Bernstein. A completely regulated price means even as global prices plummet, China's burgeoning class of SUV drivers won't feel the benefit. Given China's still-premier position as the engine of world oil demand growth, Big Oil everywhere should be worried. -- Abheek Bhattacharya Overheard A shot of nitroglycerin with your dynamite? The high-yield market has produced plenty of excitement. Those who want even more have found it in leveraged closed-end mutual funds. These don't need to raise cash to meet redemptions, but carry a different risk. Their use of borrowed money means they often have to sell holdings into a bear market to meet borrowing limits. Those who like to live really dangerously have an even more volatile product -- the ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Closed-End Fund ETN, which offers double the return of a basket of such funds. It has had an awful few weeks, dropping nearly 19% before dividends between October and Monday's close. But income-hungry investors who think junk yields are attractive may be salivating. The note's annualized yield as of Monday was over 26%. Talk about risk and reward. --- Here is another reminder why Yahoo Japan and its controlling shareholder SoftBank are unlikely to buy back shares in Yahoo Japan from old, American Yahoo anytime soon: They have better uses for the money. Yahoo Japan is acquiring Japanese restaurant and hotel booking site Ikyu for $830 million. At 63 times forward earnings, according to Jefferies, Ikyu isn't coming cheap. But there is potential. Online restaurant bookings accounted for only 1% to 2% of total reservations. The company can incorporate its in-house hotel booking system with Ikyu's. Yahoo's 35% stake in Yahoo Japan is currently worth $8.15 billion. For that amount, Yahoo Japan or SoftBank could get 10 businesses the size of Ikyu. That seems a better bet than buying back its own shares. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "Focus", "date": "17 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. The mainland\u0092s plans to modernise its financial services comes as its internet finance industry is booming, but regulators are also facing challenges following recent cases of fraud. The influence of the internet on global business will be come under the focus of this week\u0092s World Internet Conference in Zhejiang province, which opened yesterday. Internet technology professionals on the mainland have shown their adeptness at creating new business finance methods to cater to consumers. Numerous mainland online firms have been launched since 2013 in areas such as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and wealth management businesses. Before then, the mainland\u0092s finance sector was dominated by state-owned institutions. Mainland P2P lending, in particular, has grown rapidly over the past two years with at least 2,000 firms aggressively expanding their online businesses to cater to the growing demand among lenders and borrowers. Online payment services have also been well received. Yet this transformation has come just as Beijing starts to try to reform its financial system, which has long been criticised for focusing only on state-controlled firms, and being biased against smaller business. Earlier this month, it was reported that authorities froze 1.1 billion yuan (HK$1.3 billion) in funds deposited in Citic Bank by P2P online financing platform Ezubo as part of an investigation into alleged violations of banking norms and illegal fundraising. Ezubo is one of the bigger P2P lenders, with an investor base of 840,000 involving 71 billion yuan of funds sourced online. Its chairman Ding Ning was taken into police custody, while inquiries were launched into the firm\u0092s operations, Caixin reported. \u0093Internet finance is playing a complementary role in the finance industry with some existing financial services conducted on the internet,\u0094 said Qiu Jianfeng, chairman of online P2P firm Jyc99.com. \u0093But there is vast untapped potential because it is expected that financial services offered on the mainland through the internet will replace the existing financial system.\u0094 Li Yang, vice-president of Beijing\u0092s Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, estimated that about 490 million mainlanders \u0096 72 per cent of the mainland\u0092s internet population \u0096 have used online financial services. It has been estimated that the mainland\u0092s online financial services industry will record total sales of 800 billion yuan this year, with that figure likely to surpass 1 trillion yuan in 2016. Beijing is striving to widen small mainland firms\u0092 access to funds. The P2P sector, which has helped online consumers obtain loans more easily, is a result of Beijing\u0092s efforts to liberalise its interest-rate setting mechanism. But the recent number of widely publicised frauds has highlighted a lack of efficient regulatory oversight. The State Council has said it would adopt a go-slow approach towards developing internet finance while making risk control the main priority. "}
{"title": "economy", "date": "17 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. The mainland's sputtering economy is unlikely to expand more than 6.8 per cent next year as slowing trend continues, researchers say China's economy is likely to grow between 6.6 and 6.8 per cent in 2016, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said yesterday. The government think tank had once overestimated the mainland's gross domestic product growth in its annual Bluebook, but it has been far more accurate in foreseeing the big picture of China's GDP trend over the past five years: lower, lower and lower. For 2016, the government think tank is predicting a headline GDP growth rate of between 6.6 and 6.8 per cent, down from an estimated 7 per cent GDP growth this year. In addition, a research team at the People's Bank of China forecasted 6.8 per cent growth next year, a modest slowdown from an estimated 6.9 per cent growth in 2015, according to a working paper published on the central bank website yesterday. The team headed by Ma Jun, the PBOC's chief research economist, wrote that China's economic performance next year would be helped by rising exports and a more stable environment for property investment. The academy said yesterday that China's potential growth rate was falling, and that the situation had been worsened by weak external demand for Chinese products, the researchers noted. Downward pressures on the Chinese economy are intensifying continuously, the paper said. China's fixed-asset investment growth may slow to a single-digit rate next year while exports will continue to shrink, according to the forecasting team headed by Li Yang, a former deputy president of the academy and a respected economist. At the same time, the Chinese economy will not see a hard landing since the central government will loosen fiscal spending to aid growth. The paper suggested China raise its fiscal deficit to 2.12 trillion yuan (HK$2.54 trillion) - 500 billion yuan more than the 2015 budget - to boost growth. Appropriately enlarging the fiscal deficit is a necessary and \u00adfeasible option, it said. Expanding the fiscal deficit is still an \u00adeffective way to promote \u00adeconomic growth. As the central government allowed local governments to sell bonds to repay debt, risks associated with local government debt remained high, it warned. This was tantamount to asking local governments to borrow new debts to repay old ones even though debts have to be repaid eventually, the paper said. We shouldn't allow debts to accumulate like snowballs - there will be a moment of collapse.  The mainland government headed by Premier Li Keqiang (???) had set a whole-year GDP growth rate of 7 per cent for 2015, and China's real GDP growth in the third quarters was 6.9 per cent - the lowest level since the global financial crisis hit the country in late 2008 and early 2009. With a shrinking labour force, excess capacity and a huge property inventory, China is bidding farewell to its high-growth past to enter the so-called new normal stage - with growth rates likely to fall behind India's this year. Public and private institutions alike are predicting slower growth in the country. The International Monetary Fund is predicting a 6.3 per cent growth for next year; JPMorgan, 6.6 per cent; and Goldman Sachs, 6.4 per cent. "}
{"title": "China", "date": "16 December 2015", "body": "Wrapping up a two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Premier Li Keqiang called for the signing of an anti-extremism treaty, reflecting Beijing's growing concern over the Islamic State militant group's influence. Li also called on the bloc's members to maintain political security and social stability in the face of interwoven conventional and non-conventional security threats as the countries faced unprecedented global challenges. Li Lifan, a researcher with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said the bloc's members were facing new challenges in security as terrorism groups went online to recruit, raise funds and plan attacks. Almost every bloc member had seen instances of its citizens joining Islamic State, the researcher said. Once those who had left to fight for the militant group returned to their home countries, they would become a serious threat to national security, he said. But there is no unified force in the world to counter IS and we haven't seen any such push from the UN. China may hope to launch an anti-terrorism cooperative mechanism under the SCO framework, Li Lifan said. He Qisong, a professor with the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said Russia was also seeking new allies after crossing Nato in the wake of the Ukraine conflict while China was facing threats from terrorism as its domestic separatists linked up with Islamic State. The SCO meeting did not cover just security cooperation. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the bloc's members said infrastructure construction and capacity investment would take priority in regional economic integration, to help the countries weather global economic headwinds and allow them to explore new patterns of global governance. They also pledged to conduct currency swaps to safeguard against regional financial risks. The moves towards regional economic integration were aimed at increasing investment and consumption. They were also aimed at creating more jobs by, for example, building transport links between member countries, strengthening e-commerce cooperation, and offering funding to projects within the bloc, the joint statement said. CEFC China Energy Company on Tuesday said it had agreed to acquire 51 per cent of a unit of Kazakhstan's state oil and gas company, which mainly owns refinery and fuel assets in Europe. But He, the Shanghai university professor, said the pledges made during the two-day SCO meeting were more form than substance and that progress in regional cooperation remained unsatisfactory. It was important for Russia and the Central Asian nations within the bloc to abide by the contracts they had signed and to take concrete action to show they were truly committed to pushing forward cooperation, He said. They should act \u0085 to show their good faith, he said. Additional reporting by Reuters To read more content from SCMP.com, please click  here "}

Gold prices pared gains in aftermarket trading, after the Fed's rate move. Oil prices fell to new multiyear lows as U.S. commercial crude and refined-product inventories rose to a record. OPENING CALL: Central banks in Indonesia and Philippines are both expected to keep interest rates on hold when policymakers meet on Thursday.   Bank Indonesia will likely wait to cut interest rates until next year even as it's looking ways to help spur economic growth until turbulence that may arise from the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate increases and China's slowdown subside.  All 10 economists polled by the Wall Street Journal are expecting the central bank to keep the benchmark BI rate unchanged at 7.50%.  In the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is also expected to hold off changes to its monetary policy stance through the first half of 2016. All 13 economists in a Wall Street Journal poll predict the BSP will keep policy rates unchanged at its meeting. EQUITIES: U.S. stocks rose after the Federal Reserve said it would raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nine years. The Fed announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark federal-funds rate, which it has held near zero since December 2008. The move was widely expected by investors. The decision to raise rates was unanimous and Fed officials said they would likely lift gradually and see how the economy performs. The Fed's policy of ultralow rates has helped propel U.S. stocks higher since the financial crisis. Many investors say stocks can continue to advance even after the Fed begins to lift rates, since it underscores the central bank's confidence in the economy. Reaction was subdued on the floor of the NYSE after the announcement. Stocks that tend to pay out high dividends, which had rallied in recent years amid low interest rates, led the S&P 500 higher after the Fed decision. Stock markets in Europe and Asia were closed for trading when the Fed released its decision. Shares in Asia advanced, catching up with a rally the previous day in energy shares that sent Wall Street to a higher close. FOREX: The dollar advanced against the euro and the yen after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The statement from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting this year also showed officials lowered estimates for future interest-rate increases from those in September, but not as much as some predicted, analysts said, boosting the U.S. currency. The Fed language on the pace of monetary tightening sets the tone for the dollar, investors have said. The more rate increases the Fed plans over the course of 2016, the higher the probability for dollar gains, while slower tightening next year would likely spell a weaker dollar. Higher U.S. rates would make the dollar more attractive as they boost returns on assets denominated in greenbacks Trading desks at Jefferies, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and BNP Paribas met the historic news with quiet relief, but generally little excitement, as the rate increase was widely expected, traders said. Light order flow followed. Broader factors should remain dollar-positive for 2016, said Paresh Upadhyaya, portfolio manager and director of currency strategy at Pioneer Investments. With a data-dependent Fed, the market could re-evaluate its estimate for the pace of tightening on upside surprises in U.S. economic data. BONDS: U.S. government bonds strengthened, recovering from an earlier price decline, after the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates but pointed to a gradual policy-tightening path. Bond prices had fallen leading into the Fed's rate decision as investors prepared for the first rate increase in nearly a decade. But buyers stepped in shortly after the Fed's interest-rate statement, as they don't expect bond yields to rise significantly on the Fed's gradual approach to raising borrowing costs. While the two-year note's yield, which is highly sensitive to expected changes in Fed policy, has nearly doubled over the past two months, the 10-year yield's rise has been moderate because that yield is more influenced by factors other than the Fed's short-term rate policy. Sluggish global economic growth and contained inflation have kept a lid on long-term U.S. bond yields, among the highest in the developed world. The 10-year yield is modestly higher compared with 2.173% where it traded at the end of 2014. But it was below this year's peak of 2.5% reached in June. Some market observers are concerned that the Fed's tightening in the face of sluggish global growth could undermine the growth momentum in the U.S., which means higher yields on long-term bonds provide a buying opportunity. Some analysts warn investors may underestimate the pace of the Fed's rate increases in 2016. Long-term bond yields would jump if inflation flares up next year, which would drive the Fed to raise rates at a faster pace than investors anticipate. COMMODITIES: Oil prices fell to new multiyear lows as U.S. commercial crude and refined-product inventories rose to a record. U.S. oil has fallen 15% this month on concerns that the global glut of crude is set to persist into 2016 and possibly beyond. Production remains high around the world, as companies pump at full tilt to maximize revenues despite low prices. Weekly inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed an increase of 4.8 million barrels of crude oil stocks. Analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the agency to report that crude-oil inventories fell 1.4 million barrels last week. The U.S. imported 8.3 million barrels a day of crude, the highest weekly level since September 2013. Imports have risen in recent months because the U.S. production has declined and the U.S. has more storage space available for crude oil than other regions. The U.S. market is actually vacuuming up part of the global supply-demand surplus, said Tim Evans, analyst at Citigroup Inc. Supplies of gasoline and distillates, including heating oil and diesel fuel, also rose. Total crude and refined-product commercial stockpiles climbed by 5 million barrels to 1.31 billion barrels, a record in EIA data going back to 1990. Crude supplies usually fall at this time of year as refineries buy more crude to process into heating oil to meet indoor heating demand, but heating oil consumption has been low this year due to mild weather in the U.S. Late Tuesday, congressional leaders agreed to lift the 40-year-old export ban as part of a broader spending and tax bill. The bill must still be passed and signed into law. In the precious metals market, gold prices pared gains in aftermarket trading, after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in more than nine years. TODAY'S HEADLINES: Fed Raises Interest Rate to 0.25%-to-0.50% Range The Federal Reserve said it would raise its benchmark interest rate from near zero for the first time since December 2008\u0097to a range between 0.25% to 0.50%\u0097and emphasized it will likely lift it gradually thereafter in a test of the economy's capacity to stand on its own with less support from super easy monetary policy.

Norwegian politicians have been eager to establish a terminal at Veidnes on the country's northern shores to receive the field's oil, a bid to open an oil-and-gas province in the Barents Sea and boost the region's economic activity. The government has been in a dialogue with the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority on potential government support for the desired oil terminal but said it would end the talks, as the process could take as much as two years to conclude, and because the outcome remains uncertain. -- Kjetil Malkenes Hovland --- JEFFERIES GROUP Trading Revenue Fell After Retrenchment Jefferies Group LLC posted a substantial decline in fourth-quarter trading revenue and trimmed its balance sheet in the latest sign that Wall Street's risk appetite is waning. The investment-bank unit of Leucadia National Corp. reported an 82% drop in quarterly fixed-income trading revenue and a 22% decline in stock-trading revenue after it slashed securities inventories and leverage levels. The retrenchment represents an about-face for Jefferies, which in recent years has been willing to step into the void in certain businesses, such as riskier debt trading and lending to highly indebted companies. Many banks have shied away from those businesses since the financial crisis. Overall profit improved to $24.5 million, versus a loss of $99.8 million in last year's fourth quarter that was tied to write-downs of its Bache commodities and financial-derivatives unit. Jefferies said earlier this year that it would sell the business to Societe Generale SA. Total revenue declined 2.9% to $701.9 million. -- Peter Rudegair -- CHINA More Capital Left Nation in November China's central bank and financial institutions sold 221.27 billion yuan ($34.2 billion) of foreign exchange in November, according to a calculation by The Wall Street Journal based on central- bank data released Tuesday. The November figure came after a net purchase of 12.94 billion yuan of foreign currencies in October, indicating that capital resumed leaving the shores of the world's second-largest economy. Beijing has recently faced increased pressure as funds are moved offshore in response to rising expectations for a U.S. interest-rate increase and worries about slower economic growth in China. The outflow pressure rose after China's central bank surprised the market in August by devaluing its currency by around 2%. Since then, Beijing has tightened its already-stringent capital controls. -- Grace Zhu License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "The World Needs Higher U.S. Interest Rates", "date": "16 December 2015", "body": "Some investors are sure the U.S. Federal Reserve will be making a mistake if it raises interest rates this week for the first time since 2006. These investors are wrong. If the Fed holds its fire again, it risks eventually having to catch up by tightening policy aggressively, cutting short the economic recovery. That would be a much more grievous error. U.S. monetary policy has been in an emergency setting since the 2008 financial crisis. Contrary to some fears at the time, cutting interest rates almost to zero and printing vast quantities of money to buy bonds was never going to spark inflation in the aftermath of the meltdown because the economy was extremely weak. But the healing is now well advanced and there is plenty of evidence that the U.S. no longer needs virtually free money. Households that went on a borrowing binge a decade ago have now completed their deleveraging. Their debt, as a proportion of gross domestic product, at 78% is back to precrisis levels. In contrast to the situation in the eurozone, banks in the U.S. quickly regained their health by writing off bad loans, with net charge-off rates also sharply down to precrisis levels. Nor is accommodative monetary policy now necessary as a counterweight to tight fiscal policy. The cyclically adjusted U.S. budget deficit has fallen by a substantial 6.5 percentage points of GDP since 2010, but the austerity is now ending and fiscal policy is unlikely to be a headwind. Consumers also are enjoying windfall gains in inflation-adjusted income thanks to a collapse in oil and commodity prices, brought about principally by slower growth in China as Beijing strives to wean its economy off investment. U.S. household disposable incomes have been rising at a rate of more than 4% in inflation-adjusted terms since mid-2015, releasing pent-up demand for cars, housing and durable goods. All told, U.S. real-GDP growth is set to quicken to between 2.5% and 3% in 2016 from the 2% average of the past five years. This exceeds most current estimates of growth potential and fully justifies a modest rise in interest rates. The Fed seemed poised to pull the trigger in September but lost its nerve because of events in China. A badly communicated miniature depreciation of the yuan, coming on the heels of a rout in the stock market, aroused suspicions that the Chinese economy was in much worse shape than outside observers had thought. The Fed evidently agreed. Fearing Chinese weakness could derail U.S. growth, the Fed kept rates on hold -- arguably the first time that China decisively influenced the policy of a large, developed economy's central bank. Yet rather than fearing a slowdown in what had been an unsustainably high Chinese growth rate, Western policy makers should embrace its advantages. As Beijing tries to transition away from its investment-led growth model, Chinese demand for oil and other commodities should stabilize -- contributing to the fall in global prices that are so helpful for Western consumers. Beijing's slow-down will, in effect, provide a much-needed tax cut to households in the developed nations. As China winds down its wasteful capital expenditure, it will no longer crowd out profitable investment opportunities in the rest of the world. A rate rise now also would be an opportunity for the Fed to remedy the negative international effects of its policies, although those effects are often misunderstood. The most frequently cited concern is that higher rates in the U.S. will accelerate the flight of capital from emerging economies. And it's true that some short-term volatility will be unavoidable. But investors have been pulling their money out of emerging economies not because of the prospect of fractionally higher U.S. interest rates but because of the manifold policy shortcomings in countries such as Brazil, China and Russia. The money will return when their policies improve. And the right incentives for improvement will come in a global monetary environment where investors aren't so desperate for returns that they're prepared to overlook a country's policy failings. Senior policy makers in emerging markets know this, which is why they have been urging the Fed to end the uncertainty that has been destabilizing markets and get the first rate rise out of the way. The main risk to the U.S. recovery comes not from the Fed raising rates but from weakness and potential policy mistakes elsewhere pushing the U.S. dollar too high too fast. The eurozone and Japan must refrain from any further competitive devaluation, while Beijing must continue to manage successfully the difficult and painful rebalancing of its economy. But the Fed must come to terms with the fact that these developments are out of its control. For the sake of the U.S. and the world economies, the Fed cannot afford to fall behind the curve. It must heed the evidence and end its monetary state of emergency without further delay. --- Ms. Choyleva is chief economist at Lombard Street Research.

{"title": "China 's Problem With the Dollar", "date": "15 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING -- China's new pledge to unpeg its currency from the U.S. dollar underscores a difficult fact for Beijing: Actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve could blunt its efforts to rekindle Chinese growth. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates this week amid signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. Meanwhile, China's economy is going in the other direction, with Beijing cutting interest rates and making other moves to loosen monetary policy and spur slowing economic growth. A U.S. rate increase could hinder that effort. It likely would make the dollar stronger, forcing China to intervene in currency markets to maintain the peg. That means buying yuan, often from Chinese banks, which effectively takes money out of China's financial system even as Beijing tries to make more money available to its businesses and consumers. Credit already is tight for many Chinese borrowers, especially small and private companies, despite six interest-rate cuts and looser bank-reserve requirements enacted over the past 13 months. On Friday, China's central bank signaled its hope to break up that dynamic by pegging the yuan to a basket of currencies that includes the dollar, euro, yen and 10 other currencies, instead of the U.S. dollar alone. That would give the yuan room to fall against the dollar. No longer will foreign-exchange intervention undo monetary easing through renminbi purchases by the central bank, said Uwe Parpart, chief strategist at Reorient Financial Markets, a Hong Kong-based investment bank, using the official name for the yuan. Reductions in banks' reserve-requirement ratios and interest rates will directly and without obstruction benefit the Chinese economy. But China's intent also has set off selling of the yuan, both within China and in what is known as Hong Kong's offshore market, amid investor expectations that a currency basket means a weaker yuan. The dollar hit another 4 1/2-year high against the yuan Tuesday in Asia, valued at 6.4698 yuan, after hitting one on Monday. In a bid to calm the jittery markets, the PBOC said in an editorial posted on its website on Monday that China's still-high growth rate, ample foreign-exchange reserves and rising foreign demand for Chinese assets should work together to keep the Chinese currency at a reasonable equilibrium. It is far from clear that China will unpeg its currency from the dollar -- something it has said it would do in the past only to retreat. Decoupling risks a loss of investor confidence in the yuan's stability, which could lead to more money leaving China, according to Chinese officials and advisers to the central bank. Abandoning the peg would be an important step toward achieving monetary-policy independence, but destabilizing capital outflows could hold the central bank back from doing that, one of the advisers said. In early 2009, four years after it said it would divorce the yuan from the dollar, China hitched the value of its currency to the greenback again to keep the yuan from falling in the midst of the global financial crisis. China has played down the impact of a Fed rate increase. On Dec. 10, Wang Yungui, the head of the regulation department under China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said a U.S. rate increase would have some impact on China's cross-border capital flows, but it wouldn't be significant. Still, PBOC officials have hinted in recent months that they were looking for greater flexibility in how they manage the yuan. Fixing the [yuan's] exchange rate on the dollar would reduce the independence of the monetary policy, Deputy PBOC Gov. Yi Gang said at a news conference in August. China has seen weakened data from trade, industrial production, property investment and other traditional drivers of growth in recent months. The peg has complicated domestic macroeconomic policy management as economic prospects between the U.S. and China have diverged, said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former China head of the International Monetary Fund. Some economists say an overvalued yuan relative to its purchasing power has led Chinese companies to cut prices and lower wages to stay competitive. Also, China's exports to Japan and Europe in recent months have declined faster than its sales to the U.S. The overvaluation of the renminbi is a root cause of China's economic ills these days, said chief economist Lu Zhengwei at China's Industrial Bank Co. --- Ewen Chen contributed to this article.

{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "15 December 2015", "body": "South Africa's Deeper Problems Emerging-market currencies have given investors a bumpy ride this year. Even so, themoves in the South African randare more akin to whiplash. Beyond the political and market drama, South Africa's problems run deep. The South African rand lost 9% against the dollar last week and bond yields soared after President Jacob Zuma unexpectedlyfired Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, replacing him with a relative unknown, David van Rooyen. Markets took fright that the change might mark a move away from conservative fiscal policy.Monday, the currency bounced as much as 5% and yields fell after Mr. Zumagave up on Mr. van Rooyen and named Pravin Gordhan, finance minister from 2009 to 2014, to take up the post instead. The gyrations speak to how quickly confidence can crack in markets. Investors are in no mood for surprises, particularly with stresses and strains building across emerging markets, high-yield bonds and commodities. The relief is probably more that Mr. Zuma was forced swiftly to change his plans, which appeared politically motivated, and appoint a known figure with Mr. Gordhan's particular abilities as finance minister. But the bigger problem is the underlying economic problems faced by South Africa, which have remained unaddressed. South Africa's economy has slowed sharply since the global financial crisis; the International Monetary Fund in October forecast expansions of just 1.4% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016, downgrading its July forecasts by 0.6 and 0.8 percentage point, respectively. Unemployment stood at 25.3% in the third quarter. The economy has been harmed by strikes, electricity supply problems, exposure to commodities, in particular metals, and drought. South Africa's credit rating has been drifting downward for years. At the start of December, Standard & Poor's slapped a negative outlook on its triple-B-minus rating, putting it on the brink of junk status; Fitch Ratings downgraded the country one notch, also to triple-B-minus, albeit with a stable outlook. Both those moves came before Mr. Zuma's costly decision; the ratings firms cited theweak growth outlook and lack of progress on changesthat might boost the economy. S&P could downgrade the country next year, analysts at Citigroup think. The panic is over for now, but South Africa remains vulnerable: It runs a current-account deficit, and over a third of the domestic government-bond market is in the hands of nonresidents. Investors would be right to remain cautious. -- Richard Barley AstrazZeneca's Deal Making Doesn't Make Life Easier AstraZeneca seems to be making its life a little harder. The U.K. pharmaceutical company confirmed Monday that it was exploring strategic options with Acerta Pharma BV, after reports it could pay more than $5 billion for the private biotech company. A big price tag for a little-known target is enough to prompt head-scratching. Acerta also looks like it could exacerbate rather than ease Astra's near-term challenges. Astra is battling the drag of a declining base business and the demands of a full pipeline. It has been making good progress, with last month's approval of Tagrisso marking the first potential blockbuster to emerge from Astra's burgeoning oncology pipeline. But as of June, 40% of its revenues were exposed to loss of patent protection in the next three years, notes Moody's. This deal, rather like November's $2.7 billion purchase of ZS Pharma, would amp up Astra's long-term growth potential. But it also is risky. Acerta has one asset in late-stage testing, a blood-cancer treatment that showed impressive results in early-stage trials. It is hard to gauge the potential competitors in hematology by the time Acerta's drug makes it to market, perhaps in 2019 if successful. AbbVie this year bought Pharmacyclics in a deal valued at $21 billion to get control of similar drug Imbruvica, doubtless driving up values for rivals in the process. Meanwhile, Astra this year agreed to develop its immuno-oncology treatment in blood cancers in partnership with Celgene, conceding it didn't have the right capabilities in-house. That hardly inspires confidence for multibillion-dollar deal making. What Acerta wouldn't do is provide near-term revenues or cost savings to help Astra through its slump. With 21 clinical trials under way in blood cancer, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, Acerta would add to Astra's research and development demands. Astra already is juggling its budget and portfolio to increase investment. Given an effective target of $4.20 for earnings a share, linked to management's pay, the company is propping up profits with externalization deals, set to account for more than 40% of core operating profit next year, says UBS. This can be cast as judicious prioritizing; Astra has done well in getting money upfront for assets that, frankly, weren't expected by investors to amount to much anyway. But it leaves the company open to the charge of deteriorating earnings quality, and the impairment of its future cash generation. Its credit rating is also under pressure. Astra may just be plumping for the deals it can do: Reasonably priced, revenue-generating pharma midcaps are a scarce resource. And Astra ultimately is a growth story and should benefit if 2016 data shores up its pipeline. Deals like Acerta, however, won't soothe any nerves that emerge along the way. -- Helen Thomas Seeing Red As Alibaba Buys Ink Alibaba Group Holding is buying an English-language newspaper based on a flimsy business case and a political agenda. Shareholders are along for the ride. In a letter accompanying the Friday announcement, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai acknowledges the South China Morning Post and print media face challenges. Mr. Tsai's plan is to take down the paper's paywall and make its content free. Allegedly, Alibaba's proven expertise in digital distribution, especially on mobile devices will help make up for the loss of subscription revenue. This makes little sense. Alibaba operates e-commerce marketplaces in China. It has recently expanded into areas such as online video distribution but lacks a track record. The motivation appears to be political. Mr. Tsai promises independence for the paper but doesn't outline steps, such as an independent editorial committee, that would ensure this. Mr. Tsai does argue that the world needs a plurality of views when it comes to China rather than a singular thesis. He didn't explain what is meant by singular thesis, but it appears to be a reference to a perception that the West's coverage of China is uniformly critical. This isn't the agenda investors thought they were funding when they bought Alibaba in its initial public offering last year. Nor will it come cheap. Alibaba is paying roughly 11.5 times earnings over the past 12 months before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for SCMP's media assets. That compares to an average of 6.4 times for six global newspaper publishers. Alibaba shareholders should get used to being ignored. -- Aaron Back Overheard Apple's investors already were expecting a downbeat year for the iPhone. But an actual down year still seems difficult to comprehend. Wall Street has Apple selling about 238 million iPhone units for the current fiscal year. That would represent a gain of 3% from the prior year, which saw sales soar 37% thanks to the iPhone 6. Given the iPhone drives nearly two-thirds of revenue, the prospect clouds Apple's growth potential this year. Only six of the 32 analysts polled by FactSet have gone so far as to project an actual decline in iPhone unit sales this year. Morgan Stanley became the latest to do so Monday, cutting its estimate to sales of 218 million units. That would be a decline of about 6% from the prior year. Apple hasn't reported a decline in iPhone sales since launching it in 2007. But there is a time for everything. And with the stock nearly flat year to date, investors seem to fear that time is now.

Sluggish demand and overcapacity put drag on earnings growth in traditional sectors To revitalise the state sector, Beijing is exploring mergers and acquisitions as a key method to combat sluggish demand and overcapacity in state-owned firms next year, analysts say. State enterprises have seen slowing profits or even great losses in recent years, with the coal-mining and ferrous metal industries now producing only 10 and 20 per cent of the profits made in 2011 respectively, according to a report by Standard Chartered. Experts say the government will focus on mergers and acquisitions to cut the risks to the financial sector. The sector has seen several M&As lately. Just last week, China Minmetals Corp, the country\u0092s biggest metals trader, bought equipment maker China Metallurgical Group. \u0093A combination of sluggish demand and large oversupply, caused by overcapacity in China\u0092s traditional sectors, is the main drag on its economy,\u0094 said Standard Chartered analysts. \u0093We expect rapid progress in M&As in China\u0092s oversupplied sectors, such as steel, non-ferrous metals, petrochemicals and electricity generation, in the year ahead.\u0094 Overcapacity in traditional sectors has caused prices and profits of key industrial products to plunge in recent years. The producer price index, which measures the average change in selling prices of goods and services, has been dropping since March 2012. Prices of steel and coal products had fallen 40 per cent in the past four years, with steel becoming one of the largest sources of deflation in the country, the report said. One way the government can restructure the sector is allowing firms that are failing to generate profits to close down and leave the industry, then redistributing their resources to newer and more productive companies. Yet analysts say the process must be closely monitored since many of the state\u0092s traditional sectors remain major contributors to the country\u0092s gross domestic product and help support the labour market. As of October, the chemical, ferrous metal and coal-mining industries employed 4.7 million, 3.6 million and 4.4 million workers respectively, CEIC data showed. \u0093An abrupt shutdown of these industries could potentially lead to a sharp rise in unemployment and defaults in the financial market,\u0094 Standard Chartered analysts warned. At a meeting last week, the State Council called for several upgrades to restructure the sector, pushing state firms in industries like nuclear power, smart grids and high-speed railways to innovate and enter the international market, according to a report from Bank of China International. State enterprises were also required to close factories that have been unprofitable for the past three years and those that do not meet environmental, quality and safety standards. Other reforms included asking firms to restrict investment in industries that are oversupplied, sell non-core businesses and reduce public service functions, the BOC report said. Commercial banks were also required to expedite write-offs of non-performing loans in sectors with overcapacity. \u0093I think China is getting smarter \u0096 you have to be profitable to survive,\u0094 said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage. \u0093[There\u0092s] a lot of competition outside. That is the key reason [for reforms].\u0094 jessie.lau@scmp.com Profits at coalminers have fallen to 10 per cent of 2011 levels. "}

China signs US$2 billion deal with Kazakhstan on industrial capacity projects as Premier Li hosts Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting Forging closer economic ties topped the agenda yesterday in a high-level meeting among top officials of countries in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). At the two-day meeting that began yesterday in Zhengzhou (??), Henan province (??), China's Silk Road Fund signed an agreement with Kazakhstan's export and investment agency, under which the fund will set aside US$2 billion for industrial capacity cooperation projects between the two countries. The SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting was hosted by Premier Li Keqiang (???), who is actively seeking closer cooperation with nations along China's One Belt, One Road initiative to counter downturn risks. The talks, which included China, Russia, India, Iran, several central Asian countries as well as some international agencies, would discuss cooperation in trade, investment, finance, transport and counter-terrorism, said a Chinese government statement. The SCO - founded in 2001, comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan -has extended its economic reach on top of joint efforts to fight terrorism and separatism, the main threats to stability in the region. Some countries within the SCO - such as resource-rich Russia and Kazakhstan, which are heavily reliant on energy exports - have been hit with economic setbacks and currency depreciation this year as oil prices fell to a six-year low. China is also taking pains to implement measures aimed at holding back an economic downturn and revitalising growth. The gloomy global economy has taken its toll on nations in the region. Trade between China and Russia fell 29 per cent in the first 11 months compared with the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs. We need to stand together to tide over difficulties, such as the impact of recession in Russia, said senior researcher Li Dong, of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. He said one focus of the meeting was to integrate China's One Belt, One Road programme with the Russia-initiated Eurasian Economic Union, whose member nations are located primarily in northern Eurasia. The meeting will be pragmatic, with more efforts to be placed on how to develop economy among member states, which is to eradicate the rooted reason for social instability and rises of terrorism, Li Dong said. Fighting terrorism was another main focus of the meeting. Li Hui, China's ambassador to Russia, reiterated Beijing's zero-tolerance attitude towards terrorism. China would work with Russia to beef up its crackdown on cross-border and cyber crimes as well as tighten drug controls, Xinhua reported. The SCO meeting followed a summit between China and \u00adeastern European countries, also hosted by Premier Li, a fortnight ago. Li raised the idea of international industrial capacity cooperation a year ago as a strategy to strengthen Beijing's foothold in the global market after the launch of the One Road, One Belt initiative and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. He saw progress in such \u00adcooperation yesterday with the projects announced with \u00adKazakhstan. More than 10 joint projects in steel, cement and smelting would kick off next year while a rail project was expected to start by the end of the month, the Chinese government said. "}

Global policymakers might like to think they have walked on water with quantitative easing, but as Japan has shown over recent decades, once deflation gets embedded, economic miracle cures are no easy solution. The latest downturn in the energy and commodity markets is another unsettling sign that major economies and global financial markets are heading for another deflation wave. Two decades on from Japan's first foray into QE, its leaders are still battling to wrestle the economy from the grip of chronic recession risks and deflation dangers - and they remain a long way off from normalising policy. There must be many central bankers from leading industrial countries wondering how to retreat from zero interest rates and the explosion of QE-led bond purchases since 2008 that has left them with an unfathomable puzzle - how to reduce the dependency on super-easy monetary accommodation without damaging growth. This week, the US Federal Reserve will attempt to do just that when it finally lifts interest rates after seven years at zero per cent. it has decided the time is ripe to begin the return journey to neutral interest rates. The second leg of mission impossible comes later on when the Fed starts disposing of its US$4.5 trillion stockpile of QE assets. There is no date fixed for that yet, but the Fed probably wants to put it off for as long as possible. It could wreak a terrible toll on the global economy and world financial markets. The world can do without more turmoil. Since 2008, the global financial crisis has already been through three disastrous phases. The credit crunch in the US and Britain, Europe's sovereign debt crisis and more recently the emerging-market mayhem have all left global confidence in a precarious state. There may be no easy way back from a fourth wave. When the Fed eventually pares back its overbloated balance sheet, global liquidity will feel the pinch. So, too, will global asset markets, which have been kept afloat by vigorous QE pump-priming for the past seven years. Investors who have indulged in cheap, easy leverage will suffer severe withdrawal pains as rates go up and liquidity is squeezed. There will be no easy fix. Markets are already bracing for the dawn of tighter money this week, while the global economy is showing signs of fatigue. The US and British economies are losing momentum, the euro zone is mostly struggling, China is slowing and Japan has just avoided another technical recession. Emerging economies remain at risk. The continuing collapse in global commodity and oil prices reveals disturbing cracks in the world economic outlook. The drop in crude prices to the lowest levels since 2008 is symptomatic of a growing shortfall in global demand as economic activity slows. The aftermath of the global financial crisis is still being felt. Balance-sheet restructuring, debt deflation and austerity cutbacks are casting shadows over economic confidence. Consumer, business and investor optimism remains skittish and the spectre of rising US interest rates could be the tipping point for another major market meltdown. The Fed is clearly being blinded by glowing US employment numbers. But it is important to remember unemployment is a lagging, not leading, indicator. There are still weak links in the economy. World trade has already shrunk 15 per cent from a year ago. Global growth projections continue to be downgraded by leading forecasters like the International Monetary Fund. Economic sentiment remains balanced on a knife edge. If the Fed miscues and global confidence goes into knee-jerk reverse, there is little to stand in the way. The world's policymakers have run out of easy options. The global economy is building resistance to new QE initiatives and there is precious little fiscal slack left while governments continue to cut budget deficits and slash debt. Global equity, credit and bond markets could easily be swept up into the mother of all taper tantrums if the risk-off mentality gets a firmer grip. The danger is global policymakers will end up helpless bystanders without a cure. David Brown is chief executive of New View Economics "}
{"title": "China", "date": "14 December 2015", "body": "Only five months after its launch, the Shanghai-based cross-border mobile application now has 1.3 million users who are spending millions of yuan a day on everyday products including cosmetics, shampoo and napkins from Japan and South Korea. Its website offers live streams of stores and factories products at the same local retail prices to provide \u0093local shopping experience\u0094.Orders are flying in like snowflakes. Chinese consumers just can't get enough of high-quality productsXu Sheng, co-founder of Bolome \u0093Orders are flying in like snowflakes,\u0094 said Xu Sheng, the company's co-founder. \u0093Chinese consumers just can't get enough of high-quality products.\u0094 The company, with a valuation of US$200 million, is riding a wave of success thanks to Chinese outbound shopping demand; last year mainland consumers spent at least 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.2 trillion) in overseas shops, with major e-commerce businesses, including Alibaba to JD.com, all jostling to bring in overseas products to Chinese clients. While this influx of goods is a sign of rising Chinese consumer power on the global stage, it also has set alarm bells ringing, and led many Chinese scholars and policy-makers to pose a number of questions. Why is it that China, once widely regarded as the \u0093world's factory\u0094, cannot produce good enough products for its own consumers? And, in a broader sense, what should China be doing to rebalance its growth model so that it can be more sustainable? China's President Xi Jinping is thinking of a solution with a brand new name - \u0093supply-side\u0094 economic reform. Supply-side economics involves a policy that helps to increase output and employment by changing the conditions under which goods and services are supplied, especially measures that cut government involvement in the economy and allow the free market to operate. Xi said at last month's meeting of the central leading group on economic affairs that China needed to make an effort to enhance \u0093supply-side reform\u0094 - endorsing a largely academic concept into a national policy. The central economics work conference, an annual gathering of leading Chinese cadres that charts economic policies for the coming year, is expected to adopt supply-side reform as a key theme in discussions, according to mainland media reports. On top of that, it could become a distinctive feature of China's economic and social policies throughout 2016 and beyond. Economist Teng Tai, founder of Winbro Economic Research Institute, a private think-tank in Beijing, is one of the most vocal proponents of supply-side reform of the past few years. He believes China's old method of boosting economic growth is quickly losing its magic.Emphasis on supply-side reform is a way of saying that those structural reform ideas, intended by the government, haven't proceeded as smoothly or as quickly as the government had hopedMark Williams, economist \u0093Effects of demand-side measures in driving economic growth are getting weaker and weaker,\u0094 said Teng, who in 2012 sparked debate by publishing the \u0093Declaration on New Supply-side Economics\u0094. \u0093Take fixed-asset investment for instance, the government can increase infrastructure investment for sure, but the effects can be easily offset by sluggish capital spending from property developers and manufacturers,\u0094 Teng said. However, by making \u0093supply-side\u0094 efforts, such as reducing government red-tape, cutting taxes, and freeing up labour, land and capital markets, China would be able to not only prevent the economic slowdown from deepening, but also help create new sources of growth, said Teng, who attended a recent advisory meeting chaired by China's Premier Li Keqiang. \u0093The global demand for the iPhone was zero before Steve Jobs made it happen, and now many people can't do without their iPhone - that's the power of supply-side changes,\u0094 Teng said. China is in dire need of new economic dynamics as the existing old pillars are crumbling: property investment in the first 11 months of 2015 rose only 1.3 per cent when compared with the year before, which contrasted with growth of 11.9 per cent growth in 2013 ; the official purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector remained in contraction for four consecutive months up to the end of November; and exports have been falling on a year-on-year basis for four months in a row. China's stock market also remains volatile after the market rout this summer, while the yuan exchange rate has dropped to its lowest level for four years, despite the International Monetary Fund's decision last month to give the currency a nominal status of an international reserve currency. \u0093China's previous growth model has become unsustainable with rising debt-to-GDP [gross domestic product] ratios, falling capital productivity and persistent producer-price deflation,\u0094 Michael Taylor, a managing director at rating agency Moody's Investors Service, told a recent conference in Beijing. As China struggled between short-term growth stability and long-term rebalancing, China also risked \u0093disorderly de-leveraging\u0094 in the future, he said.It's like two sides of a coin - in the past, China has put too much emphasis on the demand side of things, but now the focus is moving towards the supply sideShen Jianguang, economist Apart from the ambitious goals of making China a \u0093comprehensive, well-off society\u0094 by the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary in 2021 and also a \u0093modernised socialist country\u0094 by the the time of the centenary of the People's Republic of China in 2049, Xi listed four tasks - addressing over-capacity, cutting financing costs, reducing the property inventory and preventing financial risks - as the \u0093four big battles\u0094 for 2016, the China Business News reported. Jia Kang, a government researcher and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee, is the main figure in developing China's supply-side economics theories. After retiring from his research position at the Ministry of Finance, he founded the China Academy of New Supply-side Economics in 2013, pulling together a group of economists from both public and private sectors to study the subject. \u0093A breakthrough in economic theories is needed since the approaches found in old textbooks can no longer solve today's problems,\u0094 Jia said. \u0093The leadership's emphasis on supply-side reform is a new approach for connecting theory with reality.\u0094 At the same time, Jia noted that China's supply-side economics would be different from its western forms so as to reflect China's reality. In essence, it is a systematic summary of what China needs to do to restart its economic engine. Jia has made a series of policy proposals under the banner of supply-side economics, including the encouragement of innovation, industrial upgrading and reduction of government controls. Many of Jia's policy proposals are under way already, such as boosting Chinese investment in other developing countries and the end of the one-child policy.?utm_source=factiva&utm_medium=intranet&utm_campaign=syndication_campaign Interest in supply-side economics intensified immediately after Xi used the phrase on November 10, with China's state media quick to hail it as the hallmark of the nation's new policy framework. Li followed this lead, saying that China needed to work hard - both on supply and demand. Traditionally, the theory of supply-side economics argues in favour of lower tax rates and less government intervention. Former US president Ronald Reagan adopted the theory to carry out broad-based tax cuts and government deregulation in 1980s - later dubbed \u0093Reaganomics\u0094 - which helped to pull the US economy out of a period of stagflation. China could copy the Reagan plan and carry out big tax cuts to fuel economic growth, Teng said. \u0093The most effective policy to help short-term growth is cutting taxes,\u0094 he said. \u0093If you don't have the guts to cut tax considerably, your policy cannot be labelled as supply-side economics.\u0094 The Chinese government, headed by the premier, who has a doctorate in economics, is conducting \u0093structural tax cuts\u0094, or cutting taxes selectively for small businesses and certain products, rather than introducing across-the-board tax reductions. China's fiscal revenues from January to October this year still grew faster than its GDP. Yet for some economists, the talk of supply-side economics is more of a cover-up of the limited process of change over the past three years, rather than of any brand-new approach. \u0093There's a tension in Chinese policy-making between the short-term desire to support growth and the long-term need to make the economy more efficient,\u0094 said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, in London. \u0093Emphasis on supply-side reform is a way of saying that those structural reform ideas, intended by the government, haven't proceeded as smoothly or as quickly as the government had hoped.\u0094 The Chinese government has been warmly embracing Keynesian-style economic policies in past years, such as the approach that involves powerful government influence and massive government spending. A government should act to boost \u0093aggregate demand\u0094, the late British economist John Maynard Keynes argued, especially when consumers were not spending and businesses were not investing. China's practice of such policies was at its zenith in late 2008 when the nation rolled out a massive 4 trillion yuan stimulus programme, and banks pumped out almost 10 trillion yuan credit in 2009 as the central bank put its renminbi-issuing efforts into full speed, leaving a hangover of massive debts and unneeded capacities. Due to the economic slowdown, labour supply changes and environment pollution, China's amount of freedom to adopt similar stimulus measures was narrowing, Jia said. \u0093The space is already very limited for China to conduct a Stimulus 2.0,\u0094 he said. Shen Jianguang, chief economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, said it was difficult to set strict demand-side and supply-side measures. \u0093If you want to address over-capacity, on one hand, you need to upgrade the supply, and on the other hand, you have to create demand,\u0094 Shen said. \u0093It's like two sides of a coin - in the past, China has put too much emphasis on the demand side of things, but now the focus is moving towards the supply side.\u0094 To read more content from SCMP.com, please click here "}

Ma She, deputy director of European affairs at Ministry of Commerce, also slammed banks' overseas branch network as \u0093underdeveloped\u0094 and runs on insufficient management of data sharing. The issue makes life difficult for small and medium-sized companies to obtain banking services and financing when they look to take their business overseas. Chinese corporates are hobbled by high financing cost or simply not receiving any financing at all when they attempt to go overseas, said Ma. It is a sensitive issue in meeting the state's grand plan for Beijing's \u0093Going Out\u0094 strategy. Li and Ma made their comments at a financial forum in the tropical island of Hainan on Sunday. Li said Chinese companies do not hold sufficient funds in their reserves when they invest abroad - noting that there is still insufficient risk consciousness that there is not yet a robust enough credit insurance system or investment protection for cross-border investments. Ma criticised mainland financial institutions for being serious laggards in their progress for internationalisation - he told banks to hasten their overseas branch expansion in order to provide better service coverage and delivery, with a particular focus on enhancing their capability to provide offshore asset financing.

{"title": "Business", "date": "14 December 2015", "body": "China's state owned enterprises or SOEs have seen great losses in recent years, with profits from the coal mining and ferrous metal industries producing only 10 and 20 per cent of the profits gained in 2011 respectively, according to a report by Standard Chartered. Experts say the government will focus on mergers and acquisitions moving forward to cut the risks to the country's financial sector. The sector has seen several M&As lately, with one of the most recent the buy out of equipment-maker China Metallurgical Group by China Minmetals Corporation - the country's biggest metals trader - last week. \u0093A combination of sluggish demand and large oversupply - caused by overcapacity in China's traditional sectors - is the main drag on its economy,\u0094 said Standard Chartered analysts. \u0093We expect rapid progress in M&A in China's oversupplied sectors, such as steel, non-ferrous metals, petrochemicals and electricity generation, in the year ahead.\u0094 Overcapacity in traditional sectors has caused price and profits of key industrial products to plunge in recent years. The producer price index, measuring the average change in selling prices of goods and services, dropped continuously since March 2012. Steel and coal products fell 40 per cent in the past four years, with steel becoming one of the largest sources of deflation in China, the report said. One way the government can restructure the sector include allowing firms that are failing to gain profits to close down and leave the industry, redistributing their resources to newer and more productive companies. Yet analysts say that the process must be closely monitored, since many of the state's traditional sectors remain major contributors to the nation's GDP and support the labour market. As of October, the chemical, ferrous metal and coal and mining industries employed 4.7 million, 3.6 million and 4.4 million workers respectively, CEIC data showed. \u0093An abrupt shutdown of these industries could potentially lead to a sharp rise in unemployment and defaults in the financial market,\u0094 Standard Chartered analysts warned. At a meeting last week, the State Council called for several upgrades to restructure the sector, pushing SOEs in industries like nuclear power, smart grids and high-speed railways to innovate and enter the international market, according to a report from Bank of China International. SOE's were also required to close factories that have been unprofitable for the past three years, as well as those that do not meet proper environmental, quality and safety standards. Other reforms include asking firms to restrict investment expansion in industries that are oversupplied, sell non-core businesses, and reduce public service functions, the report said. Commercial banks were required to expedite write-offs of non-performing loans in sectors with overcapacity. \u0093I think China is getting smarter - you have to be profitable to survive,\u0094 said Louis Tse Ming-kwong, director of VC Brokerage. \u0093(There's) a lot of competition outside.

{"title": "Alibaba Deal Tests  China 's Goodwill", "date": "14 December 2015", "body": "BEIJING -- Alibaba Group's purchase of Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper marks the latest in a string of moves that align Jack Ma's e-commerce giant with China's political priorities. Mr. Ma's political awareness has helped smooth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s transformation into one of the world's largest Internet companies by market value and a powerful force in the biggest online market by users. But its shift into sensitive industries such as media and finance will put to the test the political goodwill that Mr. Ma, the company's executive chairman, has cultivated over 16 years. Mr. Ma has long posited Alibaba as able to help the Chinese government attain its goals -- including job creation and entrepreneurship, boosting exports and consumption and improving public services. Such efforts have won him and Alibaba praise from Premier Li Keqiang, China's No. 2 leader. Alibaba has branched out into services for local governments, has encouraged development in the country's impoverished rural areas and has worked to develop software for a secure smartphone for use by the police. Alibaba on Friday said it agreed to buy the SCMP and other media assets of Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok's SCMP Group Ltd. Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal gives Alibaba control of a newspaper that is a significant news source about China for English speakers around the world. It also comes as China looks for ways to get its message out to the world. It adds to Alibaba's growing portfolio of media holdings as it is competing with its Chinese rivals for news and programming. But it also puts Alibaba in the politically sensitive area of Hong Kong media. Analysts have said Beijing seeks to indirectly influence media there. China's foreign ministry, State Council Information Office and the regulator overseeing the press didn't respond to requests for comment. China heavily censors domestic media reports for critical coverage. The websites of several foreign news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal's, are blocked in China. Alibaba would draw criticism if it sought to curb the paper's editorial independence to please Beijing, said Scott Kennedy, a business expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. If Alibaba tried to boost the paper's independence, it would risk displeasing China. Why would one want to intentionally put themselves between a rock and a hard place? he said. In a letter to readers, Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai dismissed suggestions that Alibaba would compromise the newspaper's editorial independence. This criticism reflects a bias of its own, as if to say newspaper owners must espouse certain views, while those that hold opposing views are 'unfit,' Mr. Tsai wrote. In fact, that is exactly why we think the world needs a plurality of views when it comes to China coverage. At home, Alibaba has also expanded into areas such as online finance, cloud computing and big data, giving the company access to valuable information about the lives and habits of millions of Chinese. These sectors are closely monitored by Beijing, or, in the case of finance, fiercely guarded by government-backed entities such as traditional banks. Entrepreneurs in general have to be both ambitious but also mindful of not flying too close to the sun, said Duncan Clark, chairman of consulting firm BDA China, an early adviser to Alibaba and the author of a book about the company coming out in the spring. The line is never clear how far they can go. Mr. Ma has emphasized that Alibaba is independent of the government even as it works to stay in Beijing's good graces. Broadly, experts say the company's rise has been largely free of government support. Government does not need you to say 'I love you.' The government wants to know that you can solve their problems. We create 14 million jobs for China, Mr. Ma said at a Wall Street Journal technology conference last year. Among such initiatives is Alibaba's effort to build up online shopping and selling in rural areas -- in line with the government's overall push to improve living standards in the countryside. In an October letter to shareholders, Mr. Ma named the development of the rural economy as one of three priorities for Alibaba, saying the company not only saw potential in the market but also wanted to close the digital divide and help reduce poverty. Much of Alibaba's initial government-relations effort focused at first on building strong ties with the government officials in Zhejiang province, where it is based. Starting in 2000, Alibaba organized an annual Internet conference at its headquarters in the city of Hangzhou that brought together chief executives of rival Chinese Internet firms as well as government officials. At that time we said look, if we can highlight Hangzhou as a center for the Internet and e-commerce, then the local government will be pleased with that, said Porter Erisman, a former Alibaba vice president in charge of international marketing and corporate affairs from 2000 to 2008. As concerns have swelled about China's slowing economic growth, Mr. Ma has frequently voiced confidence that Chinese consumption is strong, a message Beijing wants to convey to the world. Mr. Ma and Alibaba are often the subject of praise and encouragement from Mr. Li, China's premier, who last month called Mr. Ma to express his encouragement hours ahead of China's annual shopping festival known as Singles' Day.

{"title": "Yuan Shift Could Add Flexibility For  China", "date": "14 December 2015", "body": "Any move to set the yuan's value against a basket of currencies, rather than against just the dollar, would give China more room to maneuver as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise its benchmark U.S. interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade. The People's Bank of China on Friday posted an editorial sayingthat a currency basket makes more sense for the yuan. At the same time, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, a division of the PBOC, unveiled the composition of the basket. While the idea of a currency basket has been discussed before, the disclosure of a basket with specific currencies and weightings was a first. It is unclear when or even if the PBOC, which now sets the yuan's exchange rate with the dollar daily, will use the currency basket to guide the yuan. A currency basket is basically a new measuring stick. Any yuan depreciation against the dollar wouldn't seem so stark when the Chinese currency's value against the euro and the yen is thrown in as well. Expectations for a Fed rate increase have sent the dollar on a rally, with the yuan dragged higher as well against other currencies. A more expensive yuan has become a drag on the Chinese economy, making its exports less competitive in markets such as Europe. But efforts to devalue the yuan, such as changes made in August to the way the exchange rate is fixed, have spurred outflows of capital, forcing the PBOC to sell reserves to ensure the stability of the yuan. Decoupling from the dollar peg would give the PBOC more flexibility in allowing the yuan to depreciate against the dollar, economists and analysts say. They're preparing for the Fed to hike, expecting the hike would lead to a stronger dollar, said Koon Chow, a senior strategist at Union Bancaire Privee, a Swiss private bank. They don't want to be caught in the corner defending their exchange rate. The currency basket, published by the CFETS, gives a 26.4% weight to the dollar, 21.4% to the euro and 14.7% to the Japanese yen. It includes 10 other currencies. The yuan appreciated 2.93% against the basket through Nov. 30 this year, according to a release on the CFETS website. When measured just against the dollar, the yuan weakened 3% in the same period. In the forward market, investors now expect the yuan to trade at 6.77 per dollar in the next 12 months. On Friday, China's yuan fell to 6.4590 per dollar, the weakest level since July of 2011. The message from the PBOC comes just days ahead of the Fed's Dec. 15-16 meeting, during which it is widely expected to raise interest rates. The timing suggests an urgency for China to part ways with the U.S. in terms of monetary policy. Recent data show China's economy continues to lose momentum, raising the prospect of more rate cuts to spur growth and inflation in the world's second-largest economy. In view of the prospects for further dollar strength, as the U.S. economy strengthens and monetary policy tightens, there's an increasing divergence between the U.S. and the rest of the world, in particular China, said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former China head for the International Monetary Fund. So it will lead to an exchange-rate outcome that doesn't make much sense for China. Jens Nystedt, portfolio manager and head of sovereign research for the emerging-markets debt team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said the yuan could weaken between 3% and 5% versus its proposed basket of trading partners' currencies over the coming year, and could see single-digit depreciation against the dollar. The move to loosen the peg would reduce the chance of a one-off step devaluation of the Chinese currency against the dollar, Mr. Nystedt said. In addition, making the announcement ahead of the Fed meeting signals that any additional dollar strength globally won't necessarily mean [yuan] appreciation, as well. But a weaker yuan could have pronounced implications across financial markets, thanks to China's economic heft, trading linkages with many countries and its demand for commodities. Pegging to the dollar was great in a world when we had a weak dollar. Now with the dollar strong and prospects of interest rates going up in the U.S., it's not going to suit China as much, said Jason Leinwand, managing director at Riverside Risk Advisors, a New York-based currency adviser. Mr. Leinwand said he has been fielding many calls from anxious clients who do business with China. They're all looking for ways to hedge exposure to China, he said.

The $5 billion rights issue that Mr. Winters announced at the same time closedFridaywith 97% ofshareholders buying inand underwriters selling the rest into the market during the day. With that obstacle cleared, Standard Chartered still trades at less than half its forecast 2015 book value, according to FactSet. That looks incredibly cheap, but there are reasons for the gloom. The bank in effect has said it could continue to destroy shareholder value for several years. Mr. Winters's plans mean it forecasts a return on equity of 8% by 2018, which with a following economic wind and a bit of internal momentum rises to 10% by 2020. That is a conservative hurdle designed with the avoidance of failure as the priority. But with a cost of equity that is higher than 10% right now because of the risks in the emerging markets where Standard Chartered operates, such returns are a miserable promise indeed. This outlook combined with the rights issue and the fact thatassets will be cutfeeds into a declining fundamental value for the stock. Standard Chartered shares finished 2014 with a book value of GBP 11.19 ($16.97), according to FactSet. That is forecast to drop to GBP 10.23 by the end of this year, then to GBP 10.10 by the end of 2016. By the end of 2017, the book value per share should be back above where it will finish this year, according to consensus forecasts, although some analysts aren't even convinced of that. Bottom line: Few people will pay up for something whose value is going down. Emerging markets, especially in Asia, do seem likely to produce more growth and new wealth than the developed world over the next 10 or 20 years. If Standard Chartered investors could close their eyes now and open them in a decade, they would very likely find they owned a much more valuable stock. But for the next few years, Mr. Winters has pitched his promises low. Even at today's heavy discount investors face a long wait for the bank to deliver any real value. -- Paul J. Davies Retail Sales: What Is the Real Deal? Adjusted for inflation, retail sales aren't looking so poor. Too bad for retailers that they don't live in an inflation-adjusted world. The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in November from October, missing expectations of a 0.3% gain. Under the surface, however, results were better. Gasoline-station sales fell 0.8%, but probably due to falling prices. Although auto companies this month said sales in November stayed hot, the report showed sales at motor-vehicle dealers slipped 0.6%. That was probably just a quirk of seasonal adjustments. Excluding gas stations and auto dealers, sales rose 0.6%, the most since July. So, not bad. But not so good, either. Nongasoline, nonauto sales rose 3.4% from a year earlier. During the lukewarm economic expansion that ended in 2007, they gained 4.7% annually. Inflation has cooled a lot since then. As of October, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure was up just 0.2% from a year earlier. In the last expansion, it gained 2.5% annually on average. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 1.3% in October versus an average of 2% in the last expansion. So in inflation-adjusted terms, spending is stronger than it appears. To some extent, retailers benefit from this low inflation. Their wholesale prices are lower, but increases in other costs, like labor, are probably undoing the positives, and then some. So while consumer spending may actually be doing OK, stores aren't. -- Justin Lahart No Need to Worry Over Chinese Gift Basket Every five years, China promises the world a currency basket, only to remain tethered to the U.S. dollar. Investors should be on guard that this time the basket is for real. Late Friday, in typical Chinese policy-maker style, a currency department of the People's Bank of China released a cryptic, unsigned editorial saying it would begin to publish a reference rate for the yuan against a trade-weighted basket of 13 currencies. The implication is that this new reference rate will be more important than focusing exclusively on the yuan's rate versus the dollar. The PBOC said the new rate would be of great significance. Just because it is publishing a rate, of course, doesn't mean it has to follow it. In 2005, when China began to allow a gradual appreciation against the dollar, it said it would follow a basket. It repeated that promise in 2010, when it began to allow appreciation again after pausing during the global financial crisis. But back then, a basket wasn't in China's short-term interests. The dollar was weakening, so even as the yuan appreciated against the U.S. currency, it weakened against the euro, the currency of its biggest trading partner at the time, and against the yen. Now is different. Staying tied to an ascending dollar means China has allowed its currency to become very strong against basically the entire world except for the U.S. And it is at a time when Beijing has struggled to get the economy to respond to stimulus moves. Following a basket will lead to further depreciation against the dollar. If done gradually, markets may absorb the change in stride, notwithstanding howls from the U.S. Congress. Yet the chance for dislocation remains high, given that companies don't invest based on a currency basket. Dollar exposure through offshore borrowing is a fact of life for Chinese real-estate companies, airlines and energy firms. No doubt the timing just before the U.S. Federal Reserve is this week expected to lift interest rates from near-zero levels is aimed at getting ahead of further dollar strength. But it isn't just a calculated, race-to-the-bottom depreciation. Following a basket is arguably a more rational way for China to let its currency adjust to economic circumstances. -- Alex Frangos Overheard British banks must pay up to meet new regulatory demands for bonds that can be written off during a crisis, but it could have been worse. Banks face a GBP 1.4 billion ($2.1 billion) annual bill in higher interest costs on bonds meant to combat too big to fail, according to the Bank of England. The new rules are similar to global demands that the world's biggest banks issue more bonds that can be written off or forcibly converted into equity by regulators. In the U.K., they will apply to all banks. The increase in annual interest costs equals about 7% of one year's pretax profits. Yet, without these and other rules designed to stabilize a failing bank, more equity would be needed. The central bank said the resolution policy cuts about five percentage points off the capital ratio banks would otherwise need. Funding that with capital at about 10% would entail about GBP 11 billion annually. That would really hurt. --- Ford Motor has thrown another hat into the electric-vehicle ring. It plans to invest $4.5 billion in electric vehicles by 2020, aiming for 13 new ones, including hybrids. Next year, Ford will unveil a new electric version of its Focus sedan, with a range of up to 160 kilometers. That is far below the 320-kilometer-plus range of Tesla Motors' Model S sedan. Still, Tesla investors should take note.It is due to unveil its first mass-market car, the Model 3 sedan, in March. With Ford's announcement, the stakes for Tesla are that much higher to make a car that customers want and can afford, while also being able to quickly bring it to market.

{"title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)", "date": "14 December 2015", "body": "Guo Guangchang, the founder and CEO of $15 billion conglomerate Fosun International, suddenly disappeared in Shanghai Thursday. In recent months Chinese tycoons have dropped out of sight with alarming regularity. Their companies later claim, as Fosun did, that the missing executive is \"assisting in certain investigations.\" But the arrest is a fresh reminder that President Xi Jinping's anticorruption campaign is an effort to reimpose Communist Party control over the commanding heights of the economy. Fosun's president said Sunday that Mr. Guo's detention is due to personal matters. The fact that he is allowed to telephone his colleagues suggests investigators may want him to give evidence against others. But since the Party's discipline inspection units don't release details of their investigations and operate beyond the reach of the law, there is no way to know. Sudden and mysterious disappearances like Mr. Guo's have extended the terror felt by Party cadres to private entrepreneurs. Known as China's Warren Buffett because of his insurance acquisitions, he appeared to be an upright and professional manager as well as a Party loyalist. When asked about the arrest of other tycoons, Mr. Guo claimed to have nothing to fear. A Chinese refrain in the past few days goes that if it happened to him, it could happen to anybody. This captures an essential truth about China's economy: Nobody is untarred by the need for political assistance. The Party's arbitrary control over decision-making means that even the most independent entrepreneur has to cultivate relationships with officials to get access to land, capital and other resources. When officials fall from favor, those who benefited from their protection are also vulnerable. The presence of some skeletons in every businessman's closet is also a useful way for authorities to prevent tycoons from forming a political bloc that could demand checks and balances on the Party's power. The risks of arrest explains why so many rich Chinese are moving money and family members out of the country. Tycoons try to insulate their businesses from political extortion with the purchase of overseas assets. Mr. Guo's Fosun went on an acquisition spree in the past few years, buying an office tower in Manhattan and the resort operator Club Med, among other assets. It financed these with loans, bond sales and new equity. Mr. Guo had a close association with former Shanghai Vice Mayor Ai Baojun, now under investigation for severe disciplinary violations. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, a Shanghai court named Fosun in the corruption conviction of Wang Zongnan, the chairman of a state-owned supermarket chain, earlier this year. Mr. Wang was sentenced to 18 years in prison for channeling benefits to Fosun in return for the sale of two villas at less than market value. Fosun denied the accusation. Both Vice Mayor Ai and Mr. Wang have ties to former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin. Some analysts speculate that Mr. Xi's anticorruption campaign is now targeting Mr. Jiang's Shanghai faction. That would be a dangerous move, since Mr. Jiang lent his support to Mr. Xi's rise to the top of Chinese politics. Though he is 89 years old and has been out of power for more than a decade, Mr. Jiang retains considerable clout. But it seems Mr. Xi wants to consolidate his hold over Shanghai politics along with every other corner of the Chinese polity. Mr. Guo and other entrepreneurs have tried to render services to the Party and aid the projects of the current leadership. At the same time they have served their shareholders through savvy management. But Mr. Xi demands that the economy be run according to Party discipline. As the Party puts stability and control ahead of wealth creation, don't be surprised if more tycoons disappear. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

Demand is down 5.5pc in first 11 months as price cuts raise the risk of anti-dumping investigations The outlook for China\u0092s overcrowded steel industry will remain negative in the near term, as the sector is struggling with sluggish demand and excess inventory on the back of a sharp economic slowdown in China, analysts say. In addition, potential anti-dumping investigations against China\u0092s steel exports could also pose a key risk to the sector. Steel output has declined this year alongside the dramatic fall in domestic demand. China\u0092s daily crude steel output from 97 large and medium sized mills fell to 617 million tonnes per annum as of mid-November, down 2.1 per cent from early November levels, according to data released by China\u0092s Iron & Steel Association (CISA). \u0093At this run rate, we estimate steel demand fell 5.5 per cent for the first 11 months of this year,\u0094 said analysts from JP Morgan in a recent research report. Meanwhile, China\u0092s steel Purchasing Managers\u0092 Index (PMI), another indicator of steel manufacturing activity, dropped to a seven-year low of 37 per cent in November, according to the China Steel Logistics Professional Committee. The steel PMI has been running below 50 per cent for 19 consecutive months. Above 50 indicates an expansion in the sector, while a reading below 50 points to a contraction. However, on the supply side, inventories saw no sign of a significant reduction. In late November, steel mill inventories rose 1.1 per cent to 15.2 million tonnes, compared with 15 million tonnes in late October, while steel stockpiles with traders dropped 2.4 per cent to nine million tonnes versus 9.2 million tonnes in early November. Taken together, the estimated inventory level is 13.5 days in late November, up from 13.4 days in early November, according to JP Morgan. On the raw materials front, iron ore stocks at Chinese ports climbed 4 per cent to 89.5 million tonnes, up from 86.1 million tonnes in early November. Iron ore stocks at steel mills were broadly flat at 19.7 days in early November. The steel sector is still under heavy pressure from \u0093worsening supply-demand dynamics\u0094, said Yang Luo, an analyst from UBS, in a research note. The sluggish demand at home and large excess capacity have already prompted Chinese steel mills to dump steel abroad at low prices, raising the risk of anti-dumping investigations. China\u0092s total steel exports jumped 22 per cent in the first 11 months of the year to 101.7 million tonnes, official data showed Tuesday. What\u0092s more, China\u0092s Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday that it will cut export tariffs on steel billet and pig iron to 20 per cent from 25 per cent, starting next year. China\u0092s steel export growth could \u0093mildly revive in the short term\u0094, UBS predicted. However, the gap between supply and demand may still not get better. \u0093We would expect supply-demand dynamics in China to worsen over the long term,\u0094 Luo from UBS noted. There is \u0093[no] significant capacity shutdown\u0094 either through administrative measures or stricter environmental regulations, Luo said. He added that he hasn\u0092t seen \u0093substantial improvement\u0094 in market concentration stemming from industry consolidation. JP Morgan also expected the near term outlook to remain \u0093challenging\u0094 as the first-quarter of 2016 approaches, which is typically a low season for steel demand. Among steel producers, UBS maintained a \u0093sell\u0094 rating on Maanshan Steel, one of China\u0092s largest steel makers listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai. laura-he@scmp.com "}
{"title": "Business", "date": "11 December 2015", "body": "SHANGHAI\u0097Auto makers revved up sales in China in November, capitalizing on a tax break that prompted the quickest monthly gain in almost two years for the world's largest car market. But widening discounts and rising dealer inventories highlight risks ahead, analysts said. Car makers in China shipped about 2.2 million passenger vehicles\u0097sedans, sport-utility vehicles and minivans\u0097to dealers in November, 24% more than a year earlier, China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a government-backed industry group, said Thursday. That year-over-year jump, the largest since 2014, was largely due to Beijing's halving of the purchase tax on small cars to 5% from 10%, the association said. About 70% of China's new cars qualify. Before the tax reduction, China's car market had fallen into a recession as a worse-than-expected economic downturn and plummeting stock prices scared off buyers. Major car makers reported strong China sales for November\u0097up 14% from a year earlier for General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., up 22% for Nissan Motor Co. and up 33% for Honda Motor Co. But real demand recovery isn't as strong as the data suggested, analysts said. The 18% rise in retail car sales in November was well short of the 22% increase in production, Credit Suisse research showed. Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu said the average discount in November was 0.6 percentage point wider than in October\u0097a rarity, as discounts typically narrow as year-end approaches. \u0093Our latest round of dealer interviews point to consumers who had previously deferred purchases returning to the market, but new visitors remain more limited, he said. The manufacturers' group also sounded a cautious note. Dong Yang, a CAAM vice president, predicted a rise of 5% to 7% in sales of motor vehicles\u0097passenger and commercial\u0097next year, a modest improvement on the a 3.3% pace of the first 11 months of 2015. Sales of passenger cars have outpaced overall vehicle sales this year, growing 5.9%. The tax break that has dramatically lifted sales may prove counterproductive over the long term, analysts warned, by fueling output in an industry awash in overcapacity. Concerns have grown that China's latest stimulus program will encourage more plant openings. According to an estimate by UBS, China's passenger-car overcapacity this year could total about eight million cars, most from domestic makers. Before the tax break spurred sales, many car makers\u0097foreign and domestic\u0097canceled factory shifts and curtailed work hours to reduce production while cutting prices in hopes of boosting sluggish demand. \u0093The strong sales today could imply weak sales in the future as sales are probably being pulled forward, said Barclays analyst Yang Song. The last time China lowered the tax for small cars was in 2009, when the global financial crisis took a toll on auto demand. Car sales surged 53% that year and 33% the next\u0097but growth fell to single digits after the two-year policy expired. This time around, consultancy firm LMC Automotive forecast, sales of new passenger cars will be up 5% this year and 8% in 2016, but growth will slip to 4.7% in 2017, when the tax break expires.

{"title": "China  Aims to Ease IPO Controls by May", "date": "11 December 2015", "body": "SHANGHAI -- China aims to adopt a long-awaited reform to let companies and investors have more say in new share offerings as early as May, after leaders asked the country's equivalent of a parliament to approve adjustments to the current securities law later this month, two people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. The clarification came after China's State Council, or its cabinet, on Wednesday set a two-year time frame for moving from the current approval-based system for IPOs to one that requires registration only. There was a bit of misunderstanding regarding the two-year time frame. It actually refers to the time it may take to complete amendments to the entire Securities Act, which contains the current IPO system, said one of the people. IPOs have just restarted in China after being suspended since July amid the turmoil that gripped the country's stock markets during the summer. The suspension pushed back already-delayed plans to overhaul the country's system for new listings, which many investors have long blamed for distorting the country's $8.72 trillion stock market. The State Council's announcement Wednesday night had led some to fear the changes would be kicked further down the road. But the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislative body, is expected to authorize the cabinet to effectively bypass the current approval-based regime for IPOs at a meeting later this month so that change can be implemented before the securities law is fully amended, the two people said. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has already started crafting initial guidelines for the new IPO system and aims to release them for public consultation in January, the first person said. The securities regulator plans to formally issue the new rules in March, he said. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges will then adopt the new IPO system as early as May 1, he added. Under the current system, many companies, especially smaller and privately run firms, have to go through a cumbersome review process for IPOs, often having to wait several years before an approval arrives. Politically influential but badly managed state-run enterprises have regularly received preferential treatment and succeeded in listing their shares within months. Under a registration-based system, such as in the U.S., stock underwriters make decisions about whether it makes market sense to offer shares of a company to the public and how to price the stock, while the role of the market regulator is to ensure that the listing company adequately informs potential investors about aspects of its business. Beijing's control of the size and timing of stock supply makes IPOs a relative rarity in China's investment universe, which has historically led to overpricing of new shares and frenzied buying and selling after they are listed. The system has also contributed to concerns about corruption. Just hours before the State Council's announcement Wednesday, China said it had removed Yao Gang as a vice chairman of the CSRC following a statement last month from the Communist Party's anticorruption arm that he is suspected of unspecified violations. Mr. Yao, who wasn't reachable for comment, became known in financial circles as China's IPO Emperor for his role running the listings department since 2002. Since launching a sweeping push against corruption and irregularities in the stock market earlier this year, authorities have started investigations into at least three other CSRC officials previously in charge of IPO approvals. Despite indications that IPO reform will take place next year, there are still signs that Beijing will stick to its favored gradualist approach when trying bold but risky overhauls. In a statement late Wednesday following the State Council's decision, the CSRC said IPO reform won't be completed at one go and that authorities will retain control of pricing and the pace of share offerings while ensuring new stock doesn't flood the market. Around 670 companies are currently waiting for government permission to launch IPOs on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges, according to an analysis published this week by The Wall Street Journal. The Journal calculated the combined value of fundraising plans by companies waiting to list at $63 billion. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "11 December 2015", "body": "China Insurers' Yen for Property Chinese insurers have found their new love: shares of property developers. Little-known Foresea Life Insurance disclosed Friday it has become the biggest shareholder of Vanke, China's largest real-estate company by sales, after increasing its stake to 20%. The disclosure helped explain a 33% rally last week in Vanke's mainland shares. It turns out that more than a quarter of Vanke's turnover last week came from Foresea. This is the second attempt for the insurer to become Vanke's top shareholder. In August, it overtook state-owned conglomerate China Resources as Vanke's largest shareholder, after raising its stake to 15%. China Resources, not willing to play second fiddle, regained the top spot in a week. Just as investors sensed a takeover battle brewing, another insurer joined the fray. Privately held Anbang Insurance Group, which attracted global attention for its $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, said Wednesday it had bought a 5% stake in the developer. It isn't clear if China Resources is going to fight back. It would need around $1.6 billion to elbow its way back to the top, as Vanke shares have surged around 40% from August. China Resources already owns a premier developer China Resources Land and it may not want to control another. The Vanke purchases are part of a curious trend of insurance firms investing in property developers. At least $134 billion of insurance money has flooded into property shares, according to Citigroup. Insurers were forbidden from owning property assets until 2010. Earlier in the week, Anbang bought a 21% stake in another developer, Sino-Ocean, which already has China Life Insurance as its biggest shareholder. Anbang also owns big stakes in two other developers Gemdale and Financial Street. Ping An Insurance bought a 10% stake in Country Garden earlier this year. Part of the reason for the flood into property stocks is a bet on a resurgent housing market and hopes of more supportive measures from the government. All the same, these seem like risky moves. Outside China, insurers buy real estate as a stable asset class to match long-term obligations. They prefer income-generating properties, real-estate debt and high dividend-paying real-estate investment trusts. China's plays seem more cavalier, since these developers are oriented toward inherently risky construction projects. Vanke's 2.5% dividend yield hardly seems worth the volatility that comes with the shares. With insurers stampeding into property stocks, there may not be much room left for anyone else. -- Jacky Wong Dow Chemical, DuPont Bond Over Adversity At least on Wall Street, Dow Chemical's and DuPont's contemplated merger is cause for celebration. The merger talks, which would reportedly precede a split into three distinct business units, sent thecompanies' shares rocketing higher. Consolidation efforts can be seen as a remedy to difficult business conditions as sales at both companies generally have been declining since 2011. While divestitures have hurt growth, a tepid global economy and a persistently strong dollar haven't helped. And both companies' agricultural units are struggling amid a ferocious commodities bear market. Meanwhile, global competitors are trying to consolidate, too.More than one large firm has bid to acquire the Swiss agrochemical giant Syngenta this year, for instance.Everyone is talking to everyone,as Dow Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said back in October. Both companies have been under pressure from activist shareholders. DuPont's longtime chief executive retired in October, and a standstill agreement between Dow and activist Daniel Loeb has expired, raising the possibility of a proxy war. There are sound strategic reasons for pursuing a breakup by way of merger and overlapping business lines, providing ample opportunity for cost savings. Analysts at Deutsche Bank think cost synergies of $3 billion can be achieved equal to 23% of the companies' combined selling, general and administrative expenses over the past year. The logic of splitting into agriculture, specialty-chemicals and plastics units also has merit. They vary in terms of profitability, growth potential and their sensitivity to the economic cycle. Beyond that, it isn't unreasonable to expect that these units would be managed more efficiently under separate roofs. Potential pitfalls include a natural limit to value creation from cost cutting and financial engineering. Dow and DuPont also would need to satisfy antitrust regulators that a merger won't result in too much market concentration. And investors eager to see a breakup should get comfortable. A proper integration of the two companies, followed by the split, could take as long as five years to achieve, say analysts at Jefferies. Still, the talks between the chemicals giants are a sensible reaction. Belt-tightening today will enhance the benefits of a sunnier economic picture. -- Charley Grant No Easy Way For Yahoo to Say Sayonara Yahoo says it could take another year to part ways with its Alibaba Group Holding stake. Figuring out what to do with its Yahoo Japan stake could take even longer. In what it describes as a mirror image of its original plan to spin off those Alibaba holdings, Yahoo now plans to spin off its core business, along with its 35% of Yahoo Japan, into a separate entity. This would leave behind a vehicle that would essentially be just a lump of Alibaba stock. Alibaba could ultimately scoop up this entity by paying with its own shares, a neat resolution. The Yahoo Japan stake, worth $8.7 billion, is a harder case, with no logical buyer. It seems Alibaba isn't interested. SoftBank, whose 43% stake in Yahoo Japan already provides effective control, has no incentive to increase it. SoftBank stretched its balance sheet in acquiring Sprint, sending net debt equivalent to 4.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to S&P Capital IQ. It wants to invest in high-growth Internet businesses in emerging markets, especially India, which present more attractive potential returns than would a larger stake in Yahoo Japan. Nor could Yahoo Japan itself shell out for the stake. Its financials are consolidated on SoftBank's balance sheet, so if it spends cash or raises debt to acquire the stake, the net impact on SoftBank's financial position is the same as if SoftBank did so itself. Yahoo is holding on to Yahoo Japan for now. It may have no other choice. -- Aaron Back Overheard It is going to be another disappointing quarter for Wall Street's traders. Overall fourth-quarter trading revenue is expected to decline 15% to 20% compared with the previous quarter, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said at a Goldman Sachsfinancial-services conference on Wednesday. The majority of Citigroup's trading revenue comes from its fixed-income, currency and commodities unit. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan also said trading revenue would likely fall short of the third-quarter mark.Compared with a year ago, however, Mr. Moynihan said it would be up by mid-single digits. The year-over-year rise is less reassuring than it sounds. Last year, fourth-quarter trading revenue retreated 20% from the previous year. In other words, a single-digit gain would mean trading revenue remains below where it was two years ago. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}

{"title": "Supplements", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Market intervention by the authorities and uncertainties about the health of the mainland economy saw China-related funds lose much of their shine during the past 12 months. However, neither investors with an eye to the long term nor those on the lookout for bargains can afford to ignore a market with strong fundamentals and new sectors pushing to the fore. We are cautiously positive; attractive valuations are still providing downside support, says Thomas Deng, regional chief investment officer Greater China and chief China strategist for UBS Wealth Management. Despite the slowdown, China remains one of the major high-growth economies globally, which should translate into earnings-per-share growth and better market returns. While still expecting the mainland's GDP rate to decelerate in 2016, Deng predicts the effects will be mitigated by government moves to adopt an accommodative monetary policy through a willingness to cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio, and to pursue expansionary fiscal policies. Sectors regarded as part of the new economy, such as e-commerce and internet-based businesses, health care, clean energy, and environment-related enterprises should continue to prosper. Any PBOC cut in rates is likely to have a positive impact on the property sector and industries or enterprises with higher-than-average levels of debt. In 2015, the mainland government undertook extraordinary measures to stabilise the market and prevent potential systemic risk, Deng says. But some of these, such as the constraints on the futures market, should be reviewed without undue delay once overall conditions are considered as back to normal. He says investors in China funds should still be mindful of a potential outflow of capital which may follow the start of US interest rate hikes. However, with this development so long anticipated, the effects are unlikely to be dramatic. Ross Teverson, head of strategy, global emerging markets, for Jupiter Asset Management (Hong Kong), is also sanguine about the overall outlook and has confidence in the firm's China select fund. This portfolio of 38 stocks represents high-conviction, stock-specific picks. We look for underappreciated change at the company level, rather than taking macroeconomic views or allowing the fund's composition to be influenced by the benchmark, Teverson says. That is because we believe this approach not only has the potential to deliver improved long-term returns, but also leads to better diversification of risk. He adds that the fund tends to have a higher exposure than the benchmark to consumer and industrial stocks, and correspondingly lower exposure to the financial sector. This stems from the firm's preference for looking at China markets from a bottom-up perspective. Doing that, they can see enough compelling stock-specific opportunities to make them upbeat about performance and returns. Despite the top-down concerns around China, we continue to find and invest in companies where the outlook is positive, particularly in areas of the economy that will still enjoy structural growth, Teverson says. In this respect, he highlights e-commerce and education. The fund is also keeping a close eye on businesses with potential to move up the value chain. This is happening in automation, electrical equipment and vehicle manufacturing, where mainland enterprises of sufficient size and scale can take market share from European and Japanese multinationals. Since emerging market equities have generally lagged the developed markets, we can still find many examples of [mainland] companies with better long-term growth prospects, but trading at lower valuations, than their developed market counterparts, Teverson says. He believes that government intervention in support of stock markets and over-enthusiastic promotion of retail investment - even when valuations are already stretched - are questionable practices. Such actions undermine the concept of a free, dynamic market. He notes that international and individual investors remain understandably concerned about three aspects of the Chinese economy. One is the potential impact of high debt levels and slowing output. Another is the scaling down of fixed asset investment which is hurting commodity prices and represents a risk for companies dealing in raw materials. The third is the worry about rising non-performing loans for banks. Such factors have been priced into stock values, though investors are advised to be selective about exposure to financials. We should keep in mind that these are symptoms of a rebalancing of the economy towards consumption, which is in the long-term interests of stability and growth, Teverson says.

{"title": "Supplements", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. All that glitters is not gold, but also crude oil, iron ore and copper. Or so it was for the best part of a decade as investors reaped the rewards of a resources boom sparked by China's appetite for industrial materials. Commodity prices began to fall in 2008 and, while other sectors have been rebuilding from the global financial crisis, many resources still struggle. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report notes, it's been getting worse for commodity prices since 2011, especially energy and metals products. So, where are they headed in 2016? Many analysts have attributed the upswing in commodity prices to sustained strong growth in emerging market economies, in particular those in east Asia, and the downswing to softening growth in these economies and a greater supply of commodities, the IMF report explains. While commodity prices are notoriously difficult to predict, there is general agreement among analysts that they will likely remain low, given ample supplies and weak prospects for global economic growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecasts that 2016 will be a year of stabilisation for commodities stocks, with possibly a modest aggregate rebound of 2.6 per cent. This will be driven by a mild increase in oil prices, which will feed into the price of other commodities, the report predicts. EIU analysts expect that China will continue to absorb a huge quantity of raw materials, not least given a small construction-driven rebound in investment in 2016. Falling production in response to low prices or as a result of deteriorating agricultural yields will lead to a tightening in the market of several commodities, they add. Although it is likely to take several years to work through the high stock levels accumulated during the boom years, there will be medium-term support for prices in the form of rising populations and incomes in emerging markets. Goldman Sachs' latest commodities research describes the peak steel production seen in 2015 as the calm before the storm for iron ore, to be followed by a contraction as urbanisation and development are compatible with lower consumption per capita. Weaker commodity currencies are partly responsible for a 35 per cent decline in our estimate of marginal production costs over 2014-16, wrote analysts Christian Lelong and Amber Cai. The present commodities cycle reflects weaker demand in emerging markets, Lelong adds, as Chinese demand for capital-expenditure commodities used to build infrastructure and other fixed assets starts to wane, and growth shifts to less commodity-intensive sectors. This trend, combined with cost deflation among producing countries, presents a bearish outlook for the sector. Goldman Sachs notes that while oil and metals prices rallied in October, on the back of weaker US macro data, we do not believe that this signals any significant change in fundamentals. In the oil market, high frequency stocks point to an oversupplied market despite a gradual decline in US production, the report finds. And in metals markets, announced production cuts still fall far short of the quantity of metals demand at risk from a further slowdown in China. Worries over the outlook for Chinese growth have also dented expectations for copper prices next year, according to a recent Reuters poll of traders and analysts. With China as the world's number one copper consumer, they expect dampened demand for raw materials, and a continuation of the downward trend in copper prices recorded since 2011. Not everyone is downbeat. London-based Capital Economics told CNBC in November that copper's fundamentals were starting to improve. Confidence in China is showing signs of recovering as more policy stimulus is introduced, at least judging by the rebound in the equity market, analysts Julian Jessop and Caroline Bain said. Oil prices have slumped this year in line with other commodities. More of the same is on the cards. "}

U.S. government bonds pulled back, weighed down by the higher stocks. Oil prices fell slightly, setting a fresh six-year low on signs that supplies are still rising around the globe despite a glut that has collapsed prices. Gold prices closed at their lowest level in a week on anticipation of tighter U.S. monetary policy and as the dollar strengthened against other currencies. OPENING CALL: China's yuan is highly unlikely to challenge the dollar's hegemony as the world's most used reserve currency in the next 50 years despite winning International Monetary Fund backing, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The IMF last week added the yuan to its elite basket of reserve currencies, acknowledging the growing heft of the world's No. 2 economy and encouraging Beijing to move ahead with promised liberalization. But economists surveyed by the Journal expressed deep uncertainty about the country's political and economic fate. Beijing's ponderous move toward freer markets and a more open society will likely keep a tight lid on the yuan's appeal as a reserve currency in the decades ahead, many said. EQUITIES: U.S. stocks rose as investors snatched up beaten-down energy-company shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 82 points, or 0.5%, to 17575. Chevron gained 1.9%, adding 11 points to the index. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%. Its energy-company index gained 0.6% but is down more than 21% this year. Shares of scores of commodity suppliers have fallen this week on waning prices of oil and raw materials. Despite Thursday's gains, the S&P 500 is still down slightly for 2015. \u0093No one's going to make their year in the last three weeks, said Kenny Polcari, director at O'Neil Securities. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4% Thursday. In corporate news, ConocoPhillips estimated capital expenditures of $7.7 billion for next year, a 25% decline from the reduced levels the oil major expects to spend for 2015. Shares rose 1.6%. Steve Ells, co-chief executive and founder of Chipotle Mexican Grill, apologized on national television for the company's food-safety crises and detailed how the company was inspecting its food-safety procedures. Shares rose 5.1%. Asian stocks headed lower Thursday as regional central banks came into focus with less than a week before the U.S. Federal Reserve decides whether to raise interest rates. FOREX: The dollar strengthened broadly, halting two days of losses and highlighting investors' struggles over the past several trading sessions to position themselves ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. The dollar climbed 0.7% against the euro, as the common currency bought $1.0947 in late-afternoon trade. The U.S. currency had shed 1.7% versus the euro over the previous two sessions as investors continued to trim short wagers against the euro in response to a Dec. 3 meeting by the European Central Bank, which many found to have been disappointing. The U.S. currency rose 0.1% against the yen to \u00a5121.59, after losing 1.6% over the previous two trading days. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which compares the U.S. currency against a basket of widely traded currencies, increased 0.3% to 89.69. The index lost 0.9% over the previous two sessions. Many investors expect the Fed to raise its short-term, benchmark interest rate from near zero at its policy meeting on Dec. 15-16. Doing so would boost the dollar, as higher borrowing costs increase returns on dollar-denominated assets. But asset managers are less clear on the message the central bank will communicate to markets about the pace of Fed tightening. The Fed watches U.S. data closely, and will determine how quickly to raise interest rates based on the economy's health. Most recent U.S. numbers have been uneven, marked by a robust labor market and weak manufacturing data. Investors remain hesitant to take large wagers on the dollar strengthening with any conviction after the recent squeeze against the euro and the turbulence generated by falling oil prices, said Daragh Maher, currency strategist, HSBC Bank. \u0093The market's flailing a bit to understand where [the dollar] is headed after the Fed meeting, Mr. Maher said. \u0093No one wants to commit strongly in one direction or the other. Some asset managers are anticipating dollar selling after the Fed meeting, as the U.S. currency has weakened historically following a central bank move to increase rates. If so, the dollar could depreciate against the common currency to around as much as $1.15 per euro to end 2015, said Steven Barrow, head of developed-market currency strategy at Standard Bank. BONDS: U.S. government bonds pulled back, weighed down by higher stocks. Lower oil prices and a strong 30-year Treasury debt auction kept the bond market's price weakness in check. In late afternoon trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 2.239%, compared with 2.208% Wednesday. Bond yields rise as their prices fall. Despite swings this year, the 10-year yield, a foundation of global finance, was near 2.173% where it traded at the end of 2014. The stubbornly low level of bond yields reflects an uncertain global growth outlook, contained inflation, lower commodities prices and generally a low-yield world, even as the Federal Reserve is on course to embark on a fresh interest-rate increase cycle. U.S. Treasury bonds offer much higher yields compared with their peers in most of the developed world. A stronger dollar this year has inflated returns on U.S. assets purchased by foreign investors. Thursday's $13 billion sale of 30-year bonds attracted 63.9% indirect bidding, a measure of foreign demand. The gauge rose from the average of 55% for the past eight auctions of the 30-year debt and represented one of the strongest on record. A $21 billion sale of 10-year Treasury notes Wednesday drew 62% indirect bidding, the third strongest on record for the 10-year auction. COMMODITIES: Oil prices fell slightly, setting a fresh six-year low on signs that supplies are still rising around the globe despite a glut that has collapsed prices. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it pumped oil at the fastest pace last month since 2012. Data provider Genscape Inc. also said Thursday that stockpiles at Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for the benchmark U.S. futures contract, climbed to nearly 90% of capacity, stoking further fears that room to store excess crude may be running slim, according a person who had reviewed the report. U.S. oil futures for January delivery fell 40 cents, or 1.1%, to $36.76 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 38 cents, or 0.9%, to $39.73 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Both contracts are down 31% on the year and settled at the lowest level since Feb. 18, 2009. \u0093When you take out $40, when you take out the year-to-date low...momentum is on your side, pushing prices further down, said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston. \u0093In the absence of fresh news, it is just drifting, drifting, drifting. On Thursday, OPEC said its total production rose in November by 230,100 barrels a day from the previous month, to 31.695 million barrels a day\u0097the organization's highest output level since the spring of 2012. Last week, the cartel decided to abandon its output ceiling and leave members producing flat-out in a bid to defend the group's market share. OPEC also trimmed its estimates for supplies from outside the group in 2016 as it expects the plunge in prices to takes its toll on the U.S. oil industry and other rival producers in the coming months. \u0093This downward trend should accelerate in coming months, given various factors, mainly low oil prices and lower drilling activities, the report said. Gold prices closed at their lowest level in a week on anticipation of tighter U.S. monetary policy and as the dollar strengthened against other currencies.

{"title": "Business", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "The Beijing-based Economic Information Daily reported on Thursday that the government will extend preferential policies to help aid farmers in making home purchases. These include financial and interest subsidies, tax allowance as well as broadening the eligibility to include farmers as part of a government-sponsored loan programme known as the Housing Provident Fund. Large backlogs of unsold homes are common among China's smaller third and fourth-tier cities. By extending financial aid to farmers, the hope is that some of the excess inventory will be absorbed, although the policy come with risks. Farmers that fail to make their mortgage payments on time is among the compensation risk to participating financial institutions, as there is a lack of clarity over how far the government will go in backing the loans, according to the report. The Chinese government has taken a series of measures this year to help stimulate investment into the property market, including five interest cuts, however, high inventory levels remain a concern. In November, President Xi Jinping speaking at a government meeting, urged support to the property sector, including the roll-out of measures to help reduce property inventories.

{"title": "World News: King Coal Hard to Dethrone", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "MANILA -- The Philippines is set to open 23 coal-fired power plants over the next five years to meet rising electricity demand, illustrating the challenge climate-talk negotiators face in crafting a deal that reduces carbon emissions. A new draft of the agreement released Wednesday -- after almost 10 days of talks among 195 nations -- showed that some fundamental points remain up in the air, including how much money developing countries should get to help switch away from fossil fuels. The U.S. announced it would double aid to help poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change, to at least $860 million by 2020, in a signal that rich governments will stick to their part of the deal. Governments also still haven't decided by how much temperatures should be allowed to increase, or whether emerging economies will take on more responsibilities. In most of the developed world, competition from natural gas and environmental regulations have crippled the coal industry, bankrupting companies and snuffing out jobs in the U.S. and Europe. But in the Philippines and in dozens of other developing countries, coal remains an essential fuel for building more prosperous societies. The commodity is cheap and abundant, supplying about 40% of the world's energy, according to the International Energy Agency. But coal is also responsible for a third of all carbon emissions, and its use is projected to rise -- especially in Asia. Environmentally minded leaders, especially from the West, want to curb coal use. But many developing countries, aware that it fueled the industrialization of the U.S. and Europe, argue that coal is key to their future too. Manila's building bonanza will make it Asia's most coal-dependent country by 2035 as a percentage of its energy mix, according to IHS Energy Insight, a research company. Government officials say the booming economy needs the coal plants to offset declining domestic reserves of natural gas. The government's position is at odds with the country's self-image as environmentally progressive. A third of the country's power is now generated by renewable sources, chiefly geothermal and hydroelectric. Filipinos became acutely conscious of climate change after scientists blamed global warming for the intensity of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 7,000 people and ravaged the country's central provinces two years ago. At the climate talks in Paris, the Philippines is leading a 20-nation group, the Climate Vulnerable Forum, comprising countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Vietnam that are most at risk from rising temperatures. Before arriving, President Benigno Aquino III pledged the Philippines would reduce its carbon emissions 70% by 2030. We all have to do as much as we can, Mr. Aquino told Asia-Pacific leaders in Manila in November. Countries have to contribute the maximum. The Philippine government said in its Paris pledge that the 70% cut would be conditional on financial assistance and the transfer of green technology from more-developed nations, but that ambitious reductions could be made in various sectors, including energy. Yet, according to IHS, the Philippines will nearly triple its fleet of coal plants by 2020, while doubling the amount of CO2 to 70 million metric tons a year by 2025. The Philippines is hardly the only country depending on coal. Vietnam plans to double its coal plants to 40 by 2022 to tide it over until a generation of nuclear generators comes on line. Indonesia is encouraging more coal-fired plants to support its mining industry. China added an extraordinary 39 gigawatts in new coal-fired capacity last year, according to official data, enough to power millions of homes. Even Japan is building dozens of new coal plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. But while the use of coal in countries like China and India has yet to peak, the commodity is projected to be a smaller proportion of their total fuel mix in the coming decades.

{"title": "World News: Climate Negotiators Zero In on Key Issues --- U.S. pledges more aid for poorer countries but still 'long way to go' for global deal", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "PARIS -- The U.S. closed ranks with some 100 countries -- including members of the European Union, Mexico and Colombia -- in calling for a strong deal to tackle climate change, with just days of negotiations left at a summit here. A new draft of the agreement released Wednesday afternoon -- after almost 10 days of talks among 195 nations -- showed that some fundamental points remain up in the air. Governments still haven't decided by how much temperatures should be allowed to increase, how much money would be provided to poor governments to adapt to the effects of climate change and switch away from fossil fuels, and whether emerging economies will take on more responsibilities. The new draft is a step forward, but we still have a long ways to go, said Todd Stern, the U.S. special climate envoy. He urged all countries assembled in Paris to back a deal that would see governments regularly review promised cuts to greenhouse-gas emissions and pay attention to small-island states that argue global temperatures must not rise by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. This is our moment and we need to make it count, Mr. Stern said. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who presides over the Paris talks, said he aimed to deliver a new, close-to-final draft by Thursday afternoon. Many participants expect talks to stretch into the weekend rather than end as planned on Friday. By Wednesday afternoon, negotiators had whittled down the draft text to 29 pages, from 43 pages Saturday, after eliminating some of the less-contentious disputes. For instance, the draft now says governments should assess every five years whether national pledges to limit emissions are enough to keep global warming within acceptable levels. It also includes new provisions on how rich countries can help poorer governments develop the know-how to deal with climate change. How these efforts will be financed, however, is still unclear. Developed countries have promised to provide $100 billion in annual climate financing, from public and private sources, by 2020. Poor countries say this number needs to be increased in coming decades -- a commitment industrialized nations such as the U.S. and EU members are reluctant to make unless emerging economies such as China and India also chip in. An announcement by the U.S. to double aid to help poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change was a signal that rich governments will stick to their part of the deal. Annual grant funding the U.S. provides for poor countries to adapt to climate change would increase from $430 million a year to at least $860 million by 2020, a senior Obama administration official said. We will not leave the most vulnerable nations to quite literally weather the storm on their own, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a speech. Republicans in Washington have sought to block the Obama administration's attempts to provide climate finance to poorer countries, part of a strategy of undermining the administration's efforts in the Paris talks. I would remind the Obama administration and international delegates that in the U.S., authority to appropriate taxpayer dollars comes from Congress, said Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the environment. Another fought-over area is the overall goal of the deal. United Nations scientists say average temperatures must not increase by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels. Otherwise, these scientists warn, rising sea levels as well as extreme droughts and storms could threaten livelihoods and food supplies. But small-island states and other developing countries most at risk of climate change say they are doomed unless the temperature increase is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The U.S. and many other governments now back mentioning the 1.5-degree target in a final deal, opening the door to stepped-up emissions cuts further down the line and more financial help to the most-affected countries. Such a reference, however, is still disputed by some governments, which argue that a 1.5 degree target wasn't realistic, given many countries' growing energy needs. The developed world will have to decide who will switch off the lights first, said Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister of India. Among issues still in dispute is a new unified system for measuring and reporting greenhouse-gas emissions, which has been a central demand of the U.S. and the EU. Under existing climate deals, large emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil are classified as developing countries. That has shielded them from having to present detailed data on their emissions or to undergo the kind of stringent accounting checks traditional developed countries are subjected to. Mr. Javadekar insisted that India -- along with other emerging economies such as China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia -- would hold on to its status as a developing country under international climate deals. Having rich countries do the heavy lifting is the cardinal principle of climate talks, he said, since they have been emitting greenhouse gases for much longer. However, he signaled some room for flexibility, suggesting countries that are now richer than when the rich-poor split was first established could take on some more tasks. Differentiation across all pillars can be well articulated, taking into account the present circumstances, he said. But that's, I think, the hard negotiation part. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said she was optimistic that countries like India would compromise. They also know that they can't stick to this position until the end, she said.

{"title": "Heard on the Street", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "Chinese insurers have found their new love: shares of property developers. Little-known Foresea Life Insurance disclosed Friday it has become the biggest shareholder of Vanke, China's largest real estate company by sales, after increasing its stake to 20%. The disclosure helped explain the 33% rally last week in Vanke's mainland shares. It turns out that more than a quarter of Vanke's turnover last week came from Foresea. This is the second attempt for the insurer to become Vanke's top shareholder. In August, it overtook state-owned conglomerate China Resources as Vanke's largest shareholder, after raising its stake to 15%. China Resources, not willing to play second fiddle, regained the top spot in a week. Just as investors sensed a takeover battle brewing, another insurer joined the fray. Privately held Anbang Insurance Group, which attracted global attention for its $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, said Wednesday it had bought a 5% stake in the developer. It isn't clear if China Resources is going to fight back. It would need around $1.6 billion to elbow its way back to the top, as Vanke shares have surged around 40% from August. China Resources already owns a premier developer\u0097China Resources Land\u0097and it may not want to control another. The Vanke purchases are part of a curious trend of insurance firms investing in property developers. At least $134 billion of insurance money has flooded into property shares, according to Citigroup. Insurers were forbidden from owning property assets until 2010. Earlier in the week, Anbang bought a 21% stake in another developer, Sino-Ocean, which already has China Life Insurance as its biggest shareholder. Anbang also owns big stakes in two other developers\u0097Gemdale and Financial Street. Ping An Insurancebought a 10% stake in Country Garden earlier this year. Part of the reason for the flood into property stocks is the bet on a resurgent housing market and hopes of more supportive measures from the government. All the same, these seem like risky bets. Outside China, insurers buy real estate as a stable asset class to match long-term obligations. They prefer income-generating properties, real-estate debt, and high dividend paying real-estate investment trusts. China's plays seem more cavalier, since these developers are oriented toward inherently risky construction projects. Vanke's 2.5% dividend yield hardly seems worth the volatility that come with the shares. The insurance bid has caused valuations to get stretched. Vanke currently trades at 2.4 times its book value, at a premium to similar rivals. China Resources Land, for example, has a price-to-book ratio of 1.35. With insurers stampeding into property stocks, there may not be much room left for anyone else. Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com "}

The Wine Spectator contributing editor shows how the Communist Party's new stance had unexpected consequences for some of the world's finest wines. Following Mr. Li's speech, China's wine imports soared. Even modest vintages attracted higher prices than in the West. For the most part, the Chinese had no idea what they were drinking. Enthusiasm for wine outpaced knowledge, says Ms. Mustacich. The label, and the perceived value of the brand, was more important than the contents of the bottle. In particular, the classification of Bordeaux wines, dating back to 1855, provided both an attractive historical authenticity and five clear levels of status. The Chinese understood that Chateau Lafite and its few Bordeaux peers, known as premier cru or first growth wines, weren't for casual drinking. But neither did they see them as wines for laying down to drink later. These wines were, rather, a medium for profit as prices rose, or high-value gifts for purchasing favors, or for giving and gaining respect. The Lafite brand's easily recognizable five-arrow mark commanded an ever-higher premium. These Chinese collectors were new to wealth, they were new to wine, and they were obsessed with Lafite, reports Ms Mustacich. Bordeaux wines reach their markets through a Byzantine system. Wholesalers called negociants are kept at arm's length from the chateaux by intermediaries called courtiers, who guarantee the quality and provenance of the negociant's allocation. For the classified wines of Bordeaux, an annual allocation is a matter of trust and proven reliability, and very difficult to obtain. The negociants take all the risk and develop markets for the wines they buy. The sudden, rapid growth of Chinese interest came at a welcome time, as a financial recession was drying up the U.S. market. Large-scale, state-owned enterprises soon moved to maximize profit by buying portions of the negociants' allocations. These were en primeur -- brand-new wines at least 18 months from bottling, let alone drinking. It was a gamble, but as prices and demand soared it seemed a safe bet. But whereas the quality of a Louis Vuitton handbag can be relied upon year after year, and a Ferrari keeps well if your son doesn't crash it, prices of even the finest vintages can go down as well as up. And what one premier can give, another can take away. At the 2012 National People's Congress, Premier Wen Jiabao ordered a reduction in official banqueting. This was followed by a widespread clampdown on extravagant expenditures by incoming president Xi Jinping. The French, who couldn't conceive of consumers allowing their government to tell them what to drink, paid little attention. But sales of high-end wines soon collapsed in China, with some buyers simply walking away from written contracts with the negociants. Trying to enforce these contracts would have been difficult and expensive, with no chance of cooperation from the Chinese legal system. The negociants who weren't put out of business swallowed the losses as well as they could and carried on with their trade. Their deals with the chateaux had been sealed with no more than a handshake, but face proved more important in France than in China. Ms. Mustacich's palatably dry, matter-of-fact style is laced with wryly tart criticism of both the hidebound French and the corrupt and incompetent Chinese wine merchants. Her meticulously researched if sometimes complex account has a vast cast of colorful characters, from ancien regime chateau owners to startup Chinese wine makers, corrupt officials, arriviste Chinese investors, and the counterfeiters and those hunting them. The Chinese have quickly found ways to induce some lesser chateaux to sign exclusivity agreements and to cut out the negociants. They have also sought to increase profits by buying dozens of chateaux outright, although there's criticism of absentee and incompetent management. Meanwhile, French-trained Chinese wine makers look set to take over the under-$50 market, which is still safe for banqueting purposes and shows some life. The weakness of traditional markets and the failure of Russia or India to acquire a taste for significant volumes of wine has left the great names of Bordeaux increasingly in thrall to the Chinese. No premier cru chateau has yet passed into Chinese hands, but it might be a matter of time. However, as one of Ms. Mustatich's wine-trader interviewees in Hong Kong points out, for most people in China wine is still just a commodity. How many rich Chinese will open a bottle of wine at home? Zero. The problem is, we need the wine to be drunk. The Bordeaux wine industry's glass is already, it seems, half empty. --- Mr. Neville-Hadley is a Vancouver-based writer.

{"title": "World News: King Coal Hard to Dethrone in Asia", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "MANILA -- The Philippines is set to open 23 coal-fired power plants over the next five years to meet rising electricity demand, illustrating the challenge climate-talk negotiators face in crafting a deal that reduces carbon emissions. Competition from natural gas and environmental regulations have crippled the coal industry in most of the developed world, bankrupting companies and snuffing out jobs in the U.S. and Europe. But in the Philippines and in dozens of other developing countries, coal remains an essential fuel for building more prosperous societies. The commodity is cheap and abundant, supplying about 40% of the world's energy, according to the International Energy Agency. But coal is also responsible for a third of all carbon emissions, and its use is projected to rise -- especially in Asia. Environmentally minded leaders, especially from the West, want to curb coal use. But many developing countries, aware that it fueled the industrialization of the U.S. and Europe, argue that coal is key to their future too. Manila's building bonanza will make it Asia's most coal-dependent country by 2035 as a percentage of its energy mix, according to IHS Energy Insight, an energy research company. Government officials say the booming economy needs the new coal plants to offset declining domestic reserves of natural gas. The government's position is at odds with the country's self-image as environmentally progressive. A third of the country's power is now generated by renewable sources, chiefly geothermal and hydroelectric. Filipinos became acutely conscious of climate change after scientists blamed global warming for the intensity of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed over 7,000 people and ravaged the country's central provinces two years ago. At the climate talks in Paris, the Philippines is leading a 20-nation group, the Climate Vulnerable Forum, comprising countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Vietnam that are most at risk from rising temperatures. The group is arguing for far-reaching emissions cuts that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) -- less than the 2 degrees Celsius the talks have targeted. Before arriving in Paris, President Benigno Aquino III pledged the Philippines would reduce its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030. We all have to do as much as we can, Mr. Aquino told Asia-Pacific leaders in Manila in November. Countries have to contribute the maximum. The Philippine government said in its Paris pledge that the 70% cut would be conditional on financial assistance and the transfer of green technology from more developed nations, but that ambitious reductions could be made in various sectors, including energy. Yet, according to IHS, the Philippines will nearly triple its fleet of coal plants by 2020, while doubling the amount of CO2 to 70 million metric tons a year by 2025. Manila is failing to balance climate goals with the need to supply rising demand, said James Ooi, an IHS director. The Philippines is hardly the only developing country depending on coal. Vietnam plans to double its coal plants to 40 by 2022 to tide it over until a generation of nuclear generators comes on line. Thailand is boosting its use of coal as part of a security strategy designed to ease the country's dependence on natural gas. Indonesia is encouraging more coal-fired plants to support its mining industry. China added an extraordinary 39 gigawatts in new coal-fired capacity last year, according to official data, enough to power millions of homes. Even Japan is building dozens of new coal plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, which led to Tokyo's closure of nuclear plants. But while the use of coal in countries like China and India has yet to peak, the commodity is projected to be a smaller proportion of their total fuel mix in the coming decades. In contrast, the Philippine government doesn't dispute an IHS forecast that around 60% of the country's power will come from coal by 2035, up from 42% today, under current plans. Officials and energy executives say it is unfair to criticize a country whose 100 million people represent 1.4% of the world's population, but contribute what the U.S. Energy Information Administration says is just 0.3% of global emissions. The Philippines' carbon footprint is small by any measure you look at, said Erramon Aboitiz, CEO of Aboitiz Power Corp., whose plants mainly use coal and renewable energy sources. Our problem is affordability of power -- and the only way to address that is through coal. The Philippines has some of Asia's highest electricity prices because the government, unlike others, doesn't subsidize the power sector. Rates are therefore a sensitive political issue. For a developing economy where a sixth of the population still isn't connected to the main power grid, the priority has to be to assure there is enough supply, not curbing emissions, said Francisco Viray, a former energy secretary. Some environmentalists disagree. Yeb Sano, a former government climate negotiator turned activist, said vulnerable countries like the Philippines, an archipelago of 7,000 islands, must lead by example. I am very disappointed that the country is building dozens of coal power stations when it has so much potential for renewable energy, Mr. Sano said. One possible solution to help replace the Philippines' dwindling natural-gas supplies, which produces far less CO2 than coal, is liquefied natural gas. First Gen Corp., the only major Philippine power company that doesn't have coal plants, is in talks with potential partners about building a $1 billion LNG terminal, said Giles Puno, the company's president.

{"title": "Disposals", "date": "10 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Postal Savings Bank of China has sold a 17 per cent stake worth US$7 billion to 10 strategic investors including JPMorgan Chase, Temasek Holdings and Alibaba Group. The policy bank, which announced the private fundraising yesterday ahead of an expected initial public offering next year, has the mainland\u0092s largest branch network, a reach that finds its logo in towns and even villages void of other financial services. The private placement valued Postal Savings Bank at about US$41 billion. Mainland state media reported in March that the bank was mulling a US$25 billion public offering. China Life Insurance, UBS, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, China Telecommunications Corp, DBS Group Holdings and the investment arm of the World Bank also bought into the mainland bank. JPMorgan said it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement and a securities purchase agreement with Postal Savings Bank. The US bank said it would leverage retail, consumer and commercial banking franchises in the collaboration. Postal Savings Bank said the fundraising was the mainland\u0092s biggest-ever private placement. As a policy bank, it has followed the government\u0092s lead in offering the simplest banking products to the widest possible base, including small rural businesses. The reach into a growing yet unexplored market has attracted the attention of players in the mainland\u0092s e-commerce and internet industries, which continue to make inroads into rural communities in the hope of finding new markets for online goods. Alibaba, the mainland\u0092s e-commerce giant, signed a strategic partnership last year with Postal Savings Bank\u0092s parent, China Post Group, for cooperation on payments and logistics, a promising sign for a potential tie-up between the bank and the online shopping empire. But there are also worries over the legacy costs of the bank, particularly in its outdated infrastructure. It has lagged in digital and mobile innovation. In July, China Post announced it would invest 100 million yuan (HK$121 million) in a mobile payment system, long after most large mainland banks had made the digital leap. The bank offers only the most basic loan and deposit products, generating low returns. Its government minders have little appetite for introducing higher-risk products into rural communities. In that sense, the bank is hardly a growth story for investors. A customer walks out of a Beijing branch of Postal Savings Bank. The policy bank has the mainland\u0092s largest branch network.

{"title": "Markets", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "China guided the yuan to its weakest level in more than four years as the country deals with currency outflows and a slowing economy   while trying to loosen its grip on the exchange rate. The central bank is testing how far it can let market forces go in determining the yuan's value without setting off a sharp selloff and incurring wrath from trading partners, according to people familiar with the matter. \u0093It's a stress test of sorts, one of the people said. \u0093What the central bank is trying to avoid is the kind of panic selling that resulted from the August devaluation. China set the yuan at 6.414 to the U.S. dollar Wednesday, its weakest level since August 2011, continuing a month-long trend and following the market's lead. In the past, the setting didn't always coincide with where the yuan had last traded in the market, as the central bank tightened its grip to stabilize the currency. Beijing is also bowing to investor pressure to deliver on its pledge of a more market-driven yuan  , while trying to avoid a repeat of mistakes like its market-roiling summer devaluation  . The heavy selloff caught People's Bank of China officials somewhat off guard, according to people close to the central bank. The yuan has lost as much as 3.4% of its value since Aug. 10, the eve of the 2% devaluation. Efforts since then to steady the yuan have been costly. Internal estimates at the PBOC show that it spent as much as $130 billion in August alone in bolstering the yuan's value. And in recent months, Beijing has tested various ways to intervene to provide traders with forward guidance  . Rounds of monetary easing, deteriorating foreign-exchange reserves and a market convinced that China's currency has only one way to go have left Beijing in a bind. On one hand, it has vowed to global investors and the International Monetary Fund that it will act to make its currency more market-driven. On the other, billions of dollars continue to flow out and competing domestic pressures are rising. \u0093The central bank is in a dilemma right now, said Zhang Ming, a senior economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank. Mr. Zhang and other analysts now think the yuan is overvalued relative to its purchasing power, forcing Chinese companies to cut prices and lower wages to stay competitive, which could raise the specter of deflation. \u0093At the same time, the central bank should attach high importance to the risks associated with depreciation, such as Chinese companies' abilities to repay dollar-denominated debts and its potential impact on currencies of China's trading partners in Southeast Asia, he said. Investors and traders have since expected the yuan to weaken as Beijing works to boost an economy hurt by a relatively strong currency. \u0093What has happened in the past few days shows a clear intention from the authorities that they would like to see an orderly and mild depreciation of the yuan, said the head of trading at a Guangzhou-based, state-run bank. \u0093Everything, ranging from the dismal trade data to the prospect of a Fed rate increase, calls for a weaker yuan. If you ask 10 traders in China, nine will tell you that they expect the currency to depreciate in the near term. Data earlier this week showed China's foreign-exchange reserves fell in November to their lowest level in more than two years  , dropping $87.22 billion to $3.44 trillion. Economists and investors say Beijing may not be able to resist the mounting depreciation pressure on its currency, given the capital outflows  . Stephen Jen, founder of SLJ Macro Partners LLP, a London-based hedge fund, says China's pent-up demand for foreign assets \u0093must be satiated sooner or later. As China evolves \u0093from the world's largest exporter of goods to a large exporter of capital, it seems the yuan should continue to depreciate, he says. \u0093We could debate on the timing and the pace of this trend, but the direction of the trend seems to be clear, he wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Like other emerging-market currencies facing pressures from a strengthening U.S. dollar and the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, he added, China's yuan should depreciate \u0093due to capital account reasons, not current account reasons. Beijing has few options: Continue to lean on its foreign-exchange reserves, let the currency fall in an orderly manner or let the currency fall freely and lose enough value to absorb the rising economic pressures. Last week, the International Monetary Fund said it would include the yuan in its elite basket of reserve currencies  , the Special Drawing Rights, along with the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. While some critics worry that Beijing now has free rein to lets its currency fall to make its monetary policy more effective, China has vowed to communicate better with financial markets. The IMF action is merely symbolic at this point\u0097the yuan won't be added to the emergency lender's basket until October 2016. China also faces external pressure not to devalue the yuan too sharply. A big depreciation would hurt Beijing's credibility at a time when the leadership wants to attract more foreign capital. Also, China hosts the Group of 20 major economies next year. A cheaper yuan could renew U.S. election-year criticism that China is keeping its currency artificially low to help its exporters. At a press briefing after the IMF's inclusion announcement, PBOC Vice Governor Yi Gang said Beijing will continue to keep its currency \u0093stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level, intervening only to smooth excessive volatility. The weak setting Wednesday didn't trigger any sharp selling in the yuan traded onshore, which fell as much as 0.14%. The yuan traded offshore, which has lost 0.6% of its value over the past three days, was last down 0.04%. China's yuan closed trading onshore at 6.4280 to the dollar, its weakest closing level since August 2011. Shen Hong in Shanghai contributed to this article.

{"title": "Business", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "SHANGHAI\u0097Already massive, China Inc. is about to get bigger\u0097and that may not be good for the country's economy or consumers. Beijing is considering combining some of its biggest state-owned companies in a move that would tighten its grip over key parts of the world's No. 2 economy. The government said Tuesday it would merge two of the country's largest metals companies. Already it has combined train-car makers and nuclear technology firms and is in the process of combining its two largest shipping lines. It is considering combining more companies in areas ranging from telecommunications to air carriers. In recent weeks, shares of major state-owned enterprises like mobile-phone service China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. and China Telecom Corp. and carriers China Southern Airlines Co. and Air China Ltd. have surged amid speculation they will be next. China Telecom said it doesn't comment on speculation, while the others said they haven't received any information about mergers. Beijing hopes to form national champions that can better compete abroad. But experts say the moves will likely reduce competition, lead to higher prices for consumers and do little to clean up China's sprawling and largely wasteful portfolio of state-owned enterprises. \u0093China is throwing the gears of reform into reverse, said Sheng Hong, director of the Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing, an independent research group. \u0093Unprofitable state-owned companies should be closed, rather than merged, he said. China's State Council Information Office, an arm of China's cabinet, didn't respond to requests for comment. Chinese officials said in September they would try to improve competitiveness by making the companies bigger and more responsive to market forces. Other efforts include allowing a greater role for private investors and requiring managers to make sure they run like commercial entities rather than government arms. Economists say state-owned enterprises are a drag on China's economy. They enjoy cheap lands, government subsidies and easy access to bank loans. Private firms face barriers to entering sectors such as oil and banking, and state-run companies' dominance allow them to keep prices high. However, the performance of SOEs has been deteriorating. According to Morgan Stanley, the gap of return-on-assets between SOEs and private enterprises is the widest since the late 1990s. China's SOEs had an average return-on-assets rate of 4% in 2014, compared with private companies' 10%, said Kelvin Pang, an analyst at the bank. State-run Economic Information Daily, a newspaper published by the official Xinhua News Agency, reported in April that Beijing was considering merging its biggest state-owned companies to create around 40 national champions from the existing 111. Experts say companies that are probably going to be consolidated include those that are positioned by the government as trailblazers for overseas expansion, those that have overlapping business lines, and those that suffer from serious overcapacity. China's state-assets regulator on Tuesday said state-owned miner and metals trader China Minmetals Corp. will take over state-run mine contractor China Metallurgical Group Corp. Financial details weren't disclosed. The merger comes at a time when the global metals and mining industry has suffered from weakening demand and sagging prices for years. Minmetals Development Co., a flagship unit of Minmetals Group, reported a net loss of 921 million yuan ($144 million) in the first three quarters of this year. Officials at Minmetals Group declined to comment. Representatives for China Metallurgical couldn't be reached for comment. The biggest example so far is train maker CRRC Corp., formed in June from a merger of China CNR Corp. and CSR Corp. Four years ago CNR tried to undercut CSR to win a $180 million contract in Turkey that eventually went to a South Korean company. The combined company reported an 8% year-to-year fall in revenue for the third quarter ended in September as China's railway regulator pushed back the purchase of train cars to the fourth quarter. A CRRC spokesman said synergies haven't yet appeared because the merger is fresh. In the coming years, in addition to emerging markets, CRRC will consolidate its efforts on North America. \u0093The merger will help avoid internal friction, the spokesman said. CRRC derives 12% of its revenue from overseas markets, up from 7% in 2014. The central government is also considering integrating the country's two rail-link builders China Railway Group Ltd. with China Railway Construction Corp., said Wang Mengshu, a senior engineer at China's railway regulator. \u0093Such merges will help China's sales of railway technologies and services abroad, said Mr. Wang. The companies said they have no information about a merger. China is touting its high-speed-rail technology in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and America, in rivalry with global players such as Germany's Siemens AG and France's Alstom SA. \u0093In terms of cost efficiency, nobody can rival Chinese, said Mr. Wang. Siemens and Alstom said a merger wouldn't affect their businesses. China is also looking to merge its two largest shipping companies, China Ocean Shipping (Group) Co. and China Shipping (Group) Co., which suffer from industrywide overcapacity. Shares of their listed arms have been suspended from trading since August, and all said their parent companies are going through a \u0093material event in which \u0093complicated asset reorganization might be involved. China Cosco Holdings, the container division of China Ocean Shipping Group, posted a net loss of 1.7 billion yuan ($267 million) in the third quarter of this year. No. 2 China Shipping Container Lines Co. posted a loss of 1 billion yuan in the third quarter. Shipping experts say a potential merger faces complicated business structures, potential bureaucratic infighting and layoff costs. The impact globally would likely be muted. A potential merger would create the world's fourth-largest container shipping carrier with about 8% of global capacity. China's recent swap of the chiefs at China Telecom and Unicom has sparked speculation of a potential merger. Zhang Feng, spokesman for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that any integration will be decided by the market. The reduction in the number of competitors from three to two will lead to higher telecommunication costs, said Kan Kaili, a professor at the Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications. In 1994, China Telecom, then the sole provider of telecommunication services on the mainland, charged its subscribers a one-off mobile connection service of 6,000 yuan. Today, with three companies, the pricey connection service fee has gone, and earlier this year they promised to slash mobile data prices by at least a fifth by the end of 2015. Rose Yu "}

U.S. government bond prices strengthened amid solid demand at the $21 billion sale of 10-year notes. The dollar traded lower for a second day, driving it to multiweek troughs against the euro and the yen, as investors braced for next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. Gold prices grinded out a gain. OPENING CALL: South Korea's central bank is likely to keep its base rate on hold at the current record-low of 1.5% for a sixth consecutive month when its policy board meets Thursday. The latest Wall Street Journal poll shows all 20 analysts surveyed expect the Bank of Korea to stand pat on the benchmark seven-day repurchase rate at its meeting. Better-than-expected growth in the third quarter when the gross domestic product expanded 1.3% (on quarter)--the fastest in five years--has weakened the case for easing in the near future. The BOK is also viewed as being in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. Fed's policy meeting next week. The BOK lowered the rate twice earlier this year--the last time in June--to spur anemic growth. EQUITIES: U.S. stocks fell as the price of oil struggled to stabilize. Wednesday marked the third straight day of steep declines as a rout in commodities\u0097prompted by concerns about oversupply and waning demand\u0097spilled over into the stock market. So far this week the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 are both down about 2%. Shares of energy companies in the S&P 500 rose 1.3%, though their 3.8% week-to-date declines far exceed the broader market's 2.1% fall during that period. DuPont gained 12%, contributing about 53 points to the Dow, after The Wall Street Journal reported the company was in advanced talks to merge with Dow Chemical. Dow Chemical rose 12%. Materials stocks in the S&P 500 jumped 3.1%. Technology and biotechnology shares were a drag on the broader market, and small-company stocks overall declined. In other corporate news, shares Lululemon Athletica fell 13% after the athletic retailer cut its earnings forecast for the year. Costco Wholesale declined 5.4% after reporting a surprising decrease in its latest quarterly earnings amid slowing growth in membership fees for the retailer. Yahoo's stock fell 1.3% after it said it is abandoning its plan to spin off a stake in Alibaba Group Holding. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan gained 3.7% after the company said it would suspend its dividend and further cut oil-and-gas capital spending amid declines in commodity prices. In Europe, Anglo American fell 1.2% a day after the miner said it would slash jobs and suspend its dividend in response to the prolonged slump in raw-materials prices. While the energy sector has come into the spotlight in recent sessions, investors also remained focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting in December, where officials are widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates from ultralow levels. Asian markets headed lower for the second straight day, with better-than-expected economic data from Japan and China failing to stem the selling. But Chinese stocks made tentative gains after the People's Bank of China set the yuan reference rate\u0097which determines the currency's trading levels\u0097at its weakest point against the dollar in four years. FOREX: Investors pushed the dollar lower for a second day, driving it to multiweek troughs against the euro and the yen, as they braced for next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. Investors have long been lining up trades for a stronger U.S. currency amid expectations for the Fed to raise its short-term, benchmark interest rate for the first time in almost a decade. Many anticipate the Fed will raise interest rates at its Dec. 15-16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Higher U.S. borrowing costs would make the greenback more enticing to investors seeking yield. But recently, some asset managers have concluded the dollar will weaken in the immediate aftermath of next week's policy meeting\u0097as it has historically\u0097before venturing higher again, said Charles St-Arnaud, economist and currencies strategist at Nomura Securities. In addition, investors are looking to make trades and close their books as the year-end approaches, as many anticipate market activity will dry up after the Fed meeting, Mr. St-Arnaud said. In other trade, the currencies of oil-producing countries advanced for the first time in three days as investors took profits on recent dollar gains while crude prices reached near seven-year lows. In addition, investors dumped the South African rand after the country's president, Jacob Zuma, sacked Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene, in a move viewed largely as politically motivated. Markets respected Mr. Nene's fiscal discipline and the rand plunged 2.5% to a record low of 14.9685 in response. BONDS: Investors scooped up U.S. government bonds as falling oil prices raised anxiety over the global economic outlook and boosted demand for haven assets. The flight away from riskier assets boosted demand for a sale of $21 billion sale of 10-year notes, which added to the bond market's price gains. This week's fresh round of selloff in oil and many other commodities comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy between Dec. 15-16. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006, yet lower commodities added to investors' beliefs that further tightening from the Fed would be slow and gradual. Traders say lower liquidity has magnified price swings in financial markets this week and that this factor is going to affect markets more in coming weeks as many investors refrain from putting big positions and wait until the new year to allocate cash. The new 10-year notes were sold at a yield of 2.233%, lower than 2.304% investors obtained from the auction in November. But investors bid up the sale. The highlight was 62% indirect bidding, a proxy of foreign demand, was the third strongest on record for the 10-year auction. A $24 billion sale of three-year Treasury notes on Tuesday also attracted solid demand from foreign and domestic investors. A $13 billion sale of 30-year Treasury bonds is due on Thursday. The U.S. government bond market has been stabilizing after a recent swoon. Disappointment over the European Central Bank's fresh monetary stimulus last Thursday rattled bond markets in the eurozone and rippled into the U.S., sending the 10-year Treasury yield up to nearly 2.35%. COMMODITIES: Oil prices fell for the fourth day in a row as traders' focus shifted to growing inventories of refined products. U.S. and global crude benchmarks hit a fresh nearly seven-year low, the latest leg of a historic selloff spurred by a global supply glut. Crude-oil stockpiles in the U.S. unexpectedly declined last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a weekly report. But stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and diesel fuel, rose more than analysts' expected, according to the figures. Investors are becoming more concerned that the oil glut will persist in 2016 because producers around the world are still pumping at high rates. At the same time, a warm start to winter in the U.S. due to the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon has reduced demand for heating oil, which is typically robust at this time of year. Crude-oil prices initially rose following the EIA report. The fall in crude stockpiles halted a 10-week string of increases that pushed inventories near record highs. But the unexpectedly large buildup in distillates sent diesel futures tumbling. Oil prices quickly followed. In the precious metals market, gold prices gained as traders awaited next week's Federal Reserve meeting in which the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates.

{"title": "Global  Finance : Betting on a  China  Return", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "HONG KONG -- Multiple deals to take U.S.-listed Chinese companies private are being backed by big checks from investors back home who are being promised extraordinary returns when the companies relist on China's own stock markets. Non-Chinese private-equity funds used to be the main players in such transactions, which aim to profit from the sky-high valuations afforded to Chinese tech companies in their home market. A consortium led by Carlyle Group was behind the $3.5 billion leveraged buyout of Focus Media Holding Ltd. in 2013, for example. Recently, Chinese money has become key to financing these deals. Firms like Huatai Securities Co. and Changjiang Securities Co. have been pooling money raised from rich clients by selling them so-called wealth-management products, then investing the cash in buyouts of U.S.-listed Chinese technology stocks. Such firms have been major investors in some 20 take-private deals announced this year. In pitch books circulating on Chinese social media, local wealth-management firms claim investors could earn up to eight times their money by backing products that invest in deals like the planned $9 billion buyout of New York Stock Exchange-listed Qihoo 360 Technology Co. The rosy projections assume these companies' shares will rocket when they later are relisted on China's domestic exchanges, where quality tech stocks are relatively scarce. There's a huge rush for new economy companies in China, which has led to a big imbalance in demand and supply of shares, said Bao Fan, chairman and chief executive officer at China Renaissance, a tech-focused Chinese advisory firm. The market looks like heaven for intermediaries and a graveyard for investors. Products that invest in take-private deals for U.S.-listed Chinese companies aren't without risk. Deals have been stymied recently after China's stock-market regulator halted initial public offerings following the country's market slump over the summer, making it harder for Chinese companies to relist at home. Investors initially were skeptical of Qihoo's plan to go private, the biggest buyout ever of a U.S.-listed Chinese company. But full financing for the deal is now expected to be secured by the end of this year, according to people familiar with the situation. Money raised from wealth-management products has been crucial, accounting for 15% of the total $6.6 billion equity needed for the buyout, according to one pitch book. Qihoo, an Internet-security company, is expected to delist from the U.S. market by the end of the first quarter of 2016, before relisting in China as early as 2017, according to pitch books. GF Nest Investment, a wealth-management firm controlled by major Chinese investment bank GF Securities, said in a pitch book its investors can eventually expect a return of 140% to 490% on the Qihoo deal when it lists in China. Another product, managed by little-known De Yu Capital, claims investors could earn more than seven times their money. Investors in general need to put down at least 1 million yuan ($156,000) to be able to participate in those deals. Wealth-management firms typically charge investors a 2% management fee and 20% of any profits above a hurdle rate to access such deals -- similar to typical fees charged by top-tier private-equity and hedge funds. The forecast returns are based on projections that U.S.-listed Chinese technology companies will jump sharply to catch up with the valuations of their listed peers back home once they are successfully relisted in China. While Qihoo currently trades at 35 times its historic earnings, the ChiNext -- a Shenzhen market index focused on fast-growing companies -- sports a price/earnings ratio of 66. One of the pitch books for the deal compares Qihoo to Shenzhen-listed Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. Leshi's net profit in 2014 was less than 10% of Qihoo's, yet its market value is almost twice as large. --- Rick Carew contributed to this article.

{"title": "Arts", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "During China's National People's Congress in March 1996, then Premier Li Peng criticized the harmful effects of drinking harsh Chinese grain spirits and praised red wine. The result for the French wine industry was initially sweet, but with a sour finish. \u0093It was an unmistakeable signal to every official, state employee, and entrepreneur that red wine was approved by the Communist leadership, writes Suzanne Mustacich in \u0093Thirsty Dragon: China's Lust for Bordeaux and the Threat to the World's Best Wines, a wide-ranging look at the Chinese wine market in which she reveals widespread skulduggery. The Wine Spectator contributing editor shows how the Communist Party's new stance had unexpected consequences for some of the world's finest wines. Following Mr. Li's speech, China's wine imports soared. Even modest vintages attracted higher prices than in the West. \u0093For the most part, the Chinese had no idea what they were drinking. Enthusiasm for wine outpaced knowledge, says Ms. Mustacich. The label, and the perceived value of the brand, was more important than the contents of the bottle. In particular, the classification of Bordeaux wines, dating back to 1855, provided both an attractive historical authenticity and five clear levels of status. The Chinese understood that Ch\u00e2teau Lafite and its few Bordeaux peers, known as premier cru or \u0093first growth wines, weren't for casual drinking. But neither did they see them as wines for laying down to drink later. These wines were, rather, a medium for profit as prices rose, or high-value gifts for purchasing favors, or for giving and gaining respect. The Lafite brand's easily recognizable five-arrow mark commanded an ever-higher premium. \u0093These Chinese collectors were new to wealth, they were new to wine, and they were obsessed with Lafite, reports Ms Mustacich. Bordeaux wines reach their markets through a Byzantine system. Wholesalers called n\u00e9gociants are kept at arm's length from the ch\u00e2teaux by intermediaries called courtiers, who guarantee the quality and provenance of the n\u00e9gociant's allocation. For the classified wines of Bordeaux, an annual allocation is a matter of trust and proven reliability, and very difficult to obtain. The n\u00e9gociants take all the risk and develop markets for the wines they buy. The sudden, rapid growth of Chinese interest came at a welcome time, as a financial recession was drying up the U.S. market. Large-scale, state-owned enterprises soon moved to maximize profit by buying portions of the n\u00e9gociants' allocations. These were en primeur\u0097brand-new wines at least 18 months from bottling, let alone drinking. It was a gamble, but as prices and demand soared it seemed a safe bet. But whereas the quality of a Louis Vuitton handbag can be relied upon year after year, and a Ferrari keeps well if your son doesn't crash it, prices of even the finest vintages can go down as well as up. And what one premier can give, another can take away. At the 2012 National People's Congress, Premier Wen Jiabao ordered a reduction in official banqueting. This was followed by a widespread clampdown on extravagant expenditures by incoming president Xi Jinping. The French, who couldn't conceive of consumers allowing their government to tell them what to drink, paid little attention. But sales of high-end wines soon collapsed in China, with some buyers simply walking away from written contracts with the n\u00e9gociants. Trying to enforce these contracts would have been difficult and expensive, with no chance of cooperation from the Chinese legal system. The n\u00e9gociants who weren't put out of business swallowed the losses as well as they could and carried on with their trade. Their deals with the ch\u00e2teaux had been sealed with no more than a handshake, but face proved more important in France than in China. Ms. Mustacich's palatably dry, matter-of-fact style is laced with wryly tart criticism of both the hidebound French and the corrupt and incompetent Chinese wine merchants. Her meticulously researched if sometimes complex account has a vast cast of colorful characters, from ancien r\u00e9gime ch\u00e2teau owners to startup Chinese wine makers, corrupt officials, arriviste Chinese investors, and the counterfeiters and those hunting them. The Chinese have quickly found ways to induce some lesser ch\u00e2teaux to sign exclusivity agreements and to cut out the n\u00e9gociants. They have also sought to increase profits by buying dozens of ch\u00e2teaux outright, although there's criticism of absentee and incompetent management. Meanwhile, French-trained Chinese wine makers look set to take over the under-$50 market, which is still safe for banqueting purposes and shows some life. The weakness of traditional markets and the failure of Russia or India to acquire a taste for significant volumes of wine has left the great names of Bordeaux increasingly in thrall to the Chinese. No premier cru ch\u00e2teau has yet passed into Chinese hands, but it might be a matter of time. However, as one of Ms. Mustatich's wine-trader interviewees in Hong Kong points out, for most people in China wine is still just a commodity. \u0093How many rich Chinese will open a bottle of wine at home? Zero. The problem is, we need the wine to be drunk. The Bordeaux wine industry's glass is already, it seems, half empty. Mr. Neville-Hadley is a Vancouver-based writer. "}
{"title": "Business", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "Writing on August 30, 2008, to then assistant director of finance Simon Chui Wing-nin, Citic director Leslie Chang Li-hsien flagged the firm's mounting exposure to a type of hedging product known as a target redemption forward contract, writing: \u0093I am really concerned about the position we are in ... it is out of control.\u0094 Over several weeks from August onwards, Chang asked Chui and his colleagues to do regular \u0093sensitivity analysis\u0094 as Citic's exposure to the contracts totalled A$6.5 billion. These contracts allowed Citic to lock in a favourable US dollar-Australian dollar exchange rate so long as the market spot rate did not fall below the contract's strike rate. That's exactly what happened at the height of the financial crisis, leaving Citic on the hook for HK$14.7 billion owed to counterparties on the other side of the contracts.Did you put in place any cautionary system to ensure downside risk didn't creep up on you?Mr Justice Michael Hartmann Counsel for the city's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, are arguing that Citic directors were \u0093reckless\u0094 and \u0093negligent\u0094 to sign off on an exchange filing dated September 12, 2008, that made no mention of the mounting losses. Chang is named alongside four other former directors and the firm as defendants in the tribunal hearing. A victory for the SFC at the tribunal could result in fines and directorship disbarments for those found at fault and would strengthen the regulator's hand in the High Court, where is it seeking HK$1.9 billion in compensation for 4,500 affected investors who traded the company's shares between September 12 and October 20, 2008, when Citic did issue a profit warning that sent the share price plummeting. The tribunal is now in its third week and counsel for the defendants have said the company's financial position was not clear at the time the September 12 filing went out. Arguments over mark-to-market accounting and the minutia of foreign exchange hedging contracts are currently dominating tribunal proceedings. Under cross examination, Chui rejected as untrue an assertion made by several of his former colleagues that he had dialled into a key meeting and stated the mark-to-market value of the contracts would break even by the end of the year - the suggestion being that Chui had said there was no need to worry. Chui said he had not joined the call. In response to a separate line of inquiry, Chui said \u0093I believe I must have\u0094 told colleagues about the significant over hedge position Citic was taking as the firm only needed around A$500 million to support an Australian mining venture. Asked by a counsel for the SFC, Bernard Man QC, if he was concerned about the excess hedging, Chui said he was not as the spot rate had been trading above the strike price. At one point tribunal chairman Mr Justice Michael Hartmann asked Chui if he was aware of the downside risks to the forex contracts, where payout costs escalate the more the spot price moves below the strike rate, potentially exposing Citic to uncapped losses. \u0093Did you put in place any cautionary system to ensure downside risk didn't creep up on you?\u0094 Hartmann asked. Chui said that his team originally did not want to buy such contracts because of the risk but it was the only way to get the budgeted exchange rates.

{"title": "Chinese  Companies Trapped in IPO Logjam --- Government's grip, stock-market crash snarl about $63 billion in deals", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "Devotees of entrepreneur Dai Wenjun's famous duck-neck snacks are so loyal that he could even sell them bricks cooked with his signature spices, he once boasted. But he can't sell shares in his company to the public. Hunan Juewei Food Co. has been stuck for the past year in China's clogged pipeline of initial public offerings. About 675 companies are awaiting government approval to sell a total of roughly $63 billion in stock, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal of securities filings. The logjam got worse after the government halted all new stock sales in July as it scrambled to contain the Chinese stock-market crash. Even though stocks have rebounded and the IPO market is set to reopen, many chronic problems remain, according to entrepreneurs and analysts. One big snarl is the Chinese government's tight control of the initial public offering process. Listing requirements are daunting and sometimes arbitrary. Regulatory review of IPO applications can drag on for four or five years. Ambitious entrepreneurs say the consequences are especially painful now that China's economy is slowing and could benefit from new jolts of consumption and innovation, which often are fueled by stock-sale proceeds. Mr. Dai's chewy, flavorful ya bo are popular throughout central China, and his company wants to sell $150 million in stock so it can build factories in seven cities. Company officials have no idea when the IPO will be approved. The IPO pileup also includes a vaccine maker, a laser producer, a 500-store grocery chain, a subsidiary of the official Xinhua News Agency, and Shanghai Film Group, a rival to Hollywood studios. Dalian Wanda Group Co., led by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, filed in November for an initial public offering of its commercial-property business. Most of the money that Chinese companies hope to raise by going public would be steered into job creation, retail expansion and other corporate investments across China, according to the Journal's review of prospectuses filed by the 675 companies. In dollar terms, their combined stock-sale plans are roughly equivalent to all the new corporate loans made last year by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the country's largest financial institution by assets. For most Chinese companies, selling stock is the most affordable fundraising option. A spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Zhang Xiaojun, has said that restructuring the IPO system is a priority at the highest levels of government. Changes are likely to take effect next year. The move doesn't mean the regulatory requirement becomes lower. Instead, it means a shift of emphasis in the reviewing process and the improvement of the supervision method for issuance, the agency said recently. However, changes will be made only at a pace that the stock market can handle, according to Mr. Zhang. Analysts say the caveat suggests that the backlog of initial public offerings is unlikely to disappear. Just 28 companies will be allowed to finish their IPOs by year-end. All of them were approved before the government halt in July. And now that the market is reopening, other Chinese companies could file a new flood of applications to go public. Last year, China's stock exchanges handled only about 40% as many IPOs as exchanges in the U.S., but Chinese companies raised 2.6 times as much. On Friday, Chinese regulators and exchanges approved the launch next year of a circuit breaker that will trigger a 15-minute trading halt if an index of 300 stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen moves up or down 5%. A 7% swing will freeze trading for the rest of the day. The circuit-breaker mechanism and November's decision to resume IPOs are widely seen as signals of confidence by Beijing that stock prices have stabilized and it can now tackle problems in the market's structure. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has surged 21% since late August, entering bull-market territory, but still is down about 30% from its 2015 peak in June. China has had a fitful relationship with stock markets ever since former Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping let the Shanghai Stock Exchange open in 1990. If it doesn't work, let's close it, he said. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges turn 25 years old this month. Leaders have been quick to act when markets don't go their way. Beijing has frozen new stock offerings nine times for a total of five years. Behind the freezes are fears by government officials that new stock listings might sap investment from other companies, especially state-controlled firms. Since July, the IPO pipeline has grown by more than 80 companies, according to the Journal's analysis of initial public offering prospectuses. Shen Dongjun has waited half a decade for approval to take public his nationwide chain of diamond shops, Tesiro Jewelry Inc. He says the company has met all the IPO requirements for years. The government only considers the interests of investors in listed companies, but by doing this, they also hurt another bunch of companies, he says. In the U.S., companies usually go from IPO filing to stock market within three months, says Weifeng Zhong, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. In China, it can take 2 1/2 years -- or often much longer. If the slow pace of the past several years continues, some Chinese companies in the pipeline won't go public until mid-2019, the Journal's analysis shows. U.S. officials generally limit their oversight of proposed IPOs to disclosure issues. In contrast, Chinese securities regulators insist that companies churn out three straight years of profits before the company is allowed to do an initial public offering. Executives say that discourages risk-taking and slows expansion. Mr. Dai's duck-neck snacks company had a profit of $40 million in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, on revenue of $356.9 million, according to a securities filing. After an IPO application is made, companies can't restructure their ownership. Making such a change can push an application behind other firms. One company executive says the China Securities Regulatory Commission asked him not to speak to reporters during a quiet period that has lasted more than two years. Mr. Shen, the jewelry entrepreneur, says he had to turn down merger opportunities because companies can't change their ownership structure during the application process for an initial public offering. Tesiro also has lost out on potential store locations to publicly traded rivals and has had trouble keeping executives due to uncertainty about the IPO process, he adds. Even after an IPO, the company's control investor, usually its founder, can't sell shares for three years. The system creates pent-up demand that all but guarantees runaway success for new Chinese stocks. In the past six years, only about 2% of IPOs traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges fell during their first day of trading. More than a third tripled in price during the first 90 days, according to calculations by the Journal based on data from Wind Information Co. Still, China's fastest-growing companies rarely bother waiting for a domestic stock-market listing because going elsewhere is easier and faster. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. went public last year on the New York Stock Exchange, while Baidu Inc. trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market and Tencent Holdings Ltd. is on the Hong Kong stock exchange. All three rank among the world's 10 biggest Internet companies by users. Beijing has encouraged firms that shunned a domestic IPO to give Chinese stock exchanges another look. Those who do generally sidestep the traditional process by merging with an already-listed company, as advertiser Focus Media Holding Ltd. did earlier this year through a so-called backdoor listing. Some Chinese policy makers have said the government's grip on the initial public offering process politicizes it and could leave it vulnerable to corruption. Anticorruption regulators have detained two China Securities Regulatory Commission officials involved in picking stock listings. One of the officials, Yao Gang, is the agency's vice chairman and was given the nickname IPO Emperor by securities lawyers in China. The specific charges against Mr. Yao and the other man aren't known, and they aren't available for comment. The agency has described the officials as negative examples. Making the IPO process less onerous could help unlock more of the country's $22 trillion in bank savings. It also could hurt the stock-market value of state-owned corporate giants that epitomize the Communist Party's economic might, since investors might be tempted to sell those stocks and buy shares of newer, more interesting companies. Like his predecessors, Chinese President Xi Jinping has mostly kept his distance from the country's stock exchanges. But this summer's crash forced him to pay closer attention. To develop the capital market is a key goal of China's reform, which will not change just because of current market fluctuations, Mr. Xi told the Journal in September. How effectively the stock market can funnel money to businesses is seen as a test of whether the Chinese president will succeed in adding new fuel to the decelerating economy. The stock market is critical, says investment adviser Edward Tse. In order to make entrepreneurs succeed, it is not only about the entrepreneur. . . .It's also about the availability of capital. "}
{"title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "With the disappearance of two more Citic Securities executives last week, China's largest brokerage is now missing six of its eight top bosses. The widespread assumption is that they have been detained by police, but the authorities aren't saying and the company insists it is operating as \"normal.\" Citic executives began to go missing in August as authorities investigated malicious short-selling, market manipulation, insider trading and other supposed causes of the summer's nearly 40% drop in stock prices. The police also grabbed an official from Beijing's securities regulator and a journalist from the respected financial magazine Caijing, both of whom made self-abasing confessions on state television. Regulators suspended some 30 accounts from trading, including one owned by Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC. Li Yifei, head of China operations for the London-based Man Group, the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund, went incommunicado. Her husband told the press she was meeting with regulators in the Beijing suburbs. Upon returning days later, she claimed to have attended industry meetings, then taken a holiday to meditate. Authorities last month publicized the arrest of billionaire investor Xu Xiang, nicknamed hedge fund brother No. 1. Beijing then widened its crackdown by announcing investigations into several of the country's biggest securities firms, including Guosen, Haitong and Citic. China's regulators allowed an anything-goes ethos to develop in the country's stock markets, so it's easy for them to find insider trading and other misdeeds now that they are looking. Rather than reform the markets, Beijing wants to inflict pain on the brokers to assuage public anger over the crash. That anger is understandable since the government encouraged citizens to buy into President Xi Jinping's bull market for political reasons. Chinese leaders want the stock market to rise to restore confidence in the economy and cut corporate reliance on debt. But political interference risks repeating the boom and boost cycle. The International Monetary Fund's recent decision to include the Chinese yuan in its reserve-currency basket revived hope in some circles about Chinese reform. But the yuan won't become a widely accepted currency as long as the domestic financial system is directed by political imperatives rather than market forces.

{"title": "Heard on the Street /  Financial  Analysis and Commentary", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "Bluebird in A Coal Mine For Biotech A 37% tumble in shares of Bluebird Bio can be thought of as an idiosyncratic event. Still, investors ought to keep in mind that much is at stake in biotech companies with similar risk profiles. Bluebird nose-dived Monday after the gene-therapy company disclosed disappointing clinical-trial data in patients with sickle cell disease. The selloff won't affect Bluebird's operations and it is early days for gene therapy. Bluebird has nearly $1 billion in cash and securities on hand that should last the company for years. But that is small solace for investors: The stock is down 70% from May, when it commanded more than $6 billion in market value. It is tempting to think of Bluebird's woes in isolation. As a development-stage company, its share price depends largely on what happens in the laboratory and what happens there doesn't affect the clinical results of other companies. Even so, biotechnology investors of all sorts should pay attention because there are some pretty hefty bets on companies in a similar stages of development. Companies in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index with $25 million or less in trailing revenue carried an aggregate market value of $68 billion as of Monday -- more than that of Biogen. And given how far they are from generating revenue, profitability is even more distant. Granted, biotech is inherently risky, which also means rewards can be outsize, too. But as Bluebird shows, when development-stage stocks without meaningful sales or earnings fall, they can fall hard and fast. -- Charley Grant IMAXChina: Go Big or Go Home IMAXChina stands to gain as China's consumer force awakens, yet the company's fast and furious surge may have overrun fundamentals. The cinematic-technology provider premiered on the Hong Kong stock exchange only two months ago, but its share price already has gone up more than 70%. Investors snapped up the stock, knowing Chinese go to the theaters in droves -- box-office income for the first 11 months of 2015 was up 48% from a year earlier, according to Nomura -- and many are willing to spend a little more for a premium experience. IMAXChina, 68%-owned by IMAX Corp., provides giant movie screens to theaters in China using technology from its parent. But while IMAXChina has won a front-row seat in China's burgeoning movie market, its valuation leaves little room for error. It trades at 66 times this year's expected earnings, adjusted for one-off items, according to FactSet. Indeed, it trades at 26 times forecast 2018 earnings, and that is a forecast that calls for earnings to nearly triple. That means the current share price already has brewed in several years of optimism. And IMAXChina may face serious domestic competitors. The company doesn't run its own cinemas, instead relying on Chinese partners to adopt its technology. However, two of its biggest customers -- Wanda Cinema and CJ CGV, which account for more than half of IMAX theaters in China -- have developed their own giant-screen technology. IMAXChina brushes off these clones, arguing that they are going up in locations where the exhibitor can't have one of its screens because there already is an IMAX theater there with exclusive rights. But it seems to be competition, all the same. In more-developed markets, the trend of exhibitors installing their own giant screens instead of using branded technology like IMAX is well established. The number of exhibitor-developed large-format screens already has overtaken the number of IMAX screens in North America and Europe, according to market-research firm IHS. IMAXChina also faces competition from the government, which may prefer to see an indigenous player succeed. The company's biggest rival in China is China Film Giant Screen, owned by the state-owned China Film Group -- which is also one of two importers of Hollywood films into the country. Although IMAXChina is still the overwhelming leader in the field, the cheaper alternatives, some coming from its own customers, have the potential to tilt the market. With expectations so high, IMAXChina investors should remember that for big-budget movies to succeed, they also need big audiences. -- Jacky Wong For Big Oil, Even the Last Bright Spot Is Getting Dimmer When it comes to Big Oil's results, the good is a distant memory, and this year has been bad. There is still potential for things to get uglier. Prices have slid, with Brent crude Monday hitting a near-seven year low and the U.S. benchmark at its lowest since February 2009. Brent has so far averaged about $47 a barrel in the fourth quarter, down from the previous quarter's $51. U.S. natural-gas prices are lower. Prices for liquefied natural gas under contract, which tend to be linked to but lag behind oil prices, also should be coming down. This all means a continued squeeze on cash flows. But integrated giants such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total, Exxon Mobil or Chevron are starting to suffer elsewhere. Downstream businesses will feel the pain of a slump in refining margins. Downstream had been a crucial strut this year. About three-quarters of BP's underlying replacement cost profit before interest and taxes, an adjusted earnings measure, has come from downstream operations this year, versus less than a fifth in 2013. At Shell, which breaks down cash flows by business, half of operating cash flow has come from downstream, versus a fifth in 2013. While upstream operations have produced negative cash flow after capital expenditure to the tune of $5.3 billion this year, its downstream business has lessened the pain with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. That support is waning. There are multiple measures, but refining margins have clearly slumped: Barclays's benchmark puts average margins in the fourth quarter about 45% lower than the prior quarter; BP's measure of margins, which is based on its own asset portfolio, is about a third lower. Refining strength wasn't due to last. Refined-product prices initially trail falling oil prices, which first fell in mid-2014. Lower oil prices also cut some refineries' costs. Higher demand, particularly for gasoline thanks to a bumper U.S. driving season, helped sustain profitability through the summer. That is unwinding. Margins may be higher than a year ago, but the quarter-on-quarter drop has been sharper. The fourth quarter is always seasonally weaker, though relatively warm weather isn't helping diesel demand. U.S. inventories of crude and oil products are rising. Certain refineries can buy heavy crude at a discount, boosting margins. And while refining is volatile, other downstream units like BP's lubricants business are steadier performers. But it all means added pressure in 2015's final quarter. This leaves oil and gas companies more reliant still on cost cutting to salvage results. Otherwise, downstream could mean a downbeat quarter indeed. -- Helen Thomas Overheard For investors in Keurig Green Mountain, Monday's deal to take the maker of coffee pods and machines private was the market equivalent of a call from the governor. For those betting against the stock, it was the opposite. As Keurig's troubles deepened, sending its shares to $54.20 on Friday from $132.40 at the year's start, bets against it grew. Around the middle of November, there were 14.1 million shares sold short, more than double January's level. JAB Holding's agreement to buy Keurig for $92 a share makes a hash of those bets. This is a big risk of shorting: Beaten-down companies that might otherwise continue to underperform can instead get bought. This danger is especially intense now, when not only cash-laden companies looking to expand and private investors like JAB are in the hunt, but deep-pocketed activist hedge funds, too. Woes of firms like Valeant have highlighted the rewards of short selling. Keurig is a reminder of its perils. License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service "}
{"title": "World News: EU Secures Allies for Climate Deal --- Bloc forges alliance with 79 developing countries aimed at advancing global pact", "date": "9 December 2015", "body": "PARIS -- The European Union on Tuesday forged an alliance with 79 poor African and small-island countries that officials said could help break down a decades-old division between developed and developing countries in international climate talks and speed progress toward a deal. European officials presented the agreement -- which comes with 475 million euros ($517 million) in EU funding to help the developing countries reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and deal with the effects of global warming -- as their biggest breakthrough in eight days of negotiations here among 195 countries on an international deal to fight climate change. In a joint statement, the EU and the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific states -- which includes African heavyweights such as Kenya and Nigeria along with small islands most at risk from rising sea levels -- professed unity on some of the most divisive issues in the negotiations. These include having regular reviews of national commitments to cut emissions every five years and, crucially, a common system for measuring and reporting national emissions. By Wednesday morning, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is presiding over the talks, wants to present a fresh draft of the agreement. That, the French hope, would form the basis for political deal later that day and allow talks to conclude as planned on Friday. Making detailed and unified emissions reports mandatory for developing countries, which under international climate deals include big polluters such as India and China, has been a key demand of the EU and the U.S. In return for their support, the 79 countries would receive the 475 million euros in EU funding. We want to have monitoring, that's very important, said Regis Immongault, minister for sustainable development of Gabon. He added, though, that poor countries would need support, both financial and technical, to achieve the same reporting standards as richer countries. The public positioning of the African, Caribbean and Pacific -- or ACP -- countries reveals fault lines within the broader alliance of developing countries, which is known as Group of 77 and China and which represents more than 100 developing countries at the Paris talks. Large emerging markets have used the G-77 group to preserve the traditional split between developed and developing countries under international climate talks, which has placed the burden of cutting emissions and providing aid on industrialized countries. Existing climate deals also place much lighter reporting and transparency requirements on developing countries. This initiative shows that there is a broad coalition of different countries striving for an ambitious agreement, said Carole Dieschbourg, the environment minister of Luxembourg, which currently holds the presidency of the EU.

Another raft of weak trade figures comes ahead of key economic meeting The mainland\u0092s imports and exports lost more steam in November as the government continues to test ways to combat the moribund economy. The release of the data comes ahead of a key economic meeting in which President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders will set the tone for next year\u0092s policies, which could include moves to cut obsolete capacity. The country\u0092s exports dropped for the fifth consecutive month last month, down 6.8 per cent year on year, the General Administration of Customs said yesterday. Imports fell 8.7 per cent over the previous year, the 13th straight month of decline. The imports figure was better than the drop of 18.8 per cent recorded in October, but the improvement was largely due to a lower base of comparison and did not suggest any improvement in domestic demand, said Xie Yaxuan, an economist with China Merchants Securities. The markets responded negatively to the poor trade data, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index extending losses to close down 1.89 per cent, at 3,470.07. Hong Kong\u0092s Hang Seng Index lost 1.34 per cent to end at 21,905.13. Combined exports and imports fell 8.5 per cent in the January-November period, and were unlikely to meet expected trade growth of 6 per cent for the year. Customs added that export pressure would remain significant into the new year. The trade data offers a snapshot of the transition that China\u0092s economy is undergoing as the central government refrains from quantitative easing-style stimulus while trying to revamp its fundamentals through deep reforms. China Business News reported yesterday that Xi vowed at a meeting with party elite last month to launch four major economic policy goals. The objectives could be raised again at the Central Economic Work Conference, which is expected to be held in the coming weeks. Xi asked the government to address overcapacity, lower business costs, digest unsold housing units and prevent financial risks, the report said, citing unidentified sources. The same issues have been highlighted before by leaders and senior officials, but significant progress has yet to be seen. Economists expect the retirement of \u0093zombie companies\u0094 \u0096 found mainly in sectors plagued by overcapacity and systemic losses \u0096 will be accelerated next year and more details on implementing reform of state-owned enterprises to be announced. Economists and observers in the West have expressed concern that Beijing\u0092s enthusiasm for reforms seems to have faded. The escalating anti-corruption campaign had made local leaders reluctant to push ahead with economic policy changes, one observer said, adding that bold steps were not expected until after 2017. The data also showed the trade surplus remained at a resilient US$54.1 billion in November, down from October\u0092s surplus of US$61.6 billion. But the excess would not give any firm support to the yuan\u0092s exchange rate amid large capital outflow pressures, said China Merchants Securities\u0092 Xie. The country\u0092s foreign exchange reserves fell US$87.2 billion in November, to US$3.44 trillion. "}
{"title": "The view", "date": "8 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. While visiting yet another gentrifying neighbourhood in Melbourne, Australia, recently, I spotted a rather imperial-looking bird strutting about with a dignified crown. It turned out to be a crested pigeon. Even our pigeons are living the grand life, my companion quipped. He was ribbing me because in my two weeks in Australia, I had more than once commented that so many people seem to be living the good life. For instance, in America I have friends who are teachers, and their credit cards are maxed out. Here, an in-law retired from teaching on a Friday with a full pension started a new job on the following Monday and is now building an imposing house on a block of urban land that cost nearly A$1 million (HK$5.7 million). Australia is in a similar category to China: everyone has been waiting for the bubble to burst, but it hasn't. This includes many Australians, with at least one online newspaper here having a special icon to click to read aggregated stories on the Australian housing bubble. Australia is dependent on foreign investors to plug its large current-account deficit; has household debt levels at 175 per cent of gross domestic product; is reliant on a slowing and risk-prone China; has high business costs, including high wages; and has a stupendously expensive property market. Yet it evaded a crash. The economy slowed but is now adding new jobs and expanding. Interest rates fell to a record low, acting as an automatic stabiliser, with the percentage of disposable income spent on interest payments falling from nearly 15 per cent to 7 per cent, thus boosting the scope for everyday consumption. The central bank paused in its policy setting about seven months ago. It's a coffee-led recovery, a friend in Melbourne jokes. Indeed the many cafes are packed with customers in Sydney, Melbourne and even the country towns. Some of the patrons seem rather carefree and hip - whimsical streaks of blue or chartreuse in their hair, intricate tattoos, pricey ostrich-skin boots paired with jean shorts. The expression better to be lucky than smart comes to mind. Is the issue that after nearly two decades of uninterrupted economic growth, Australians suffer from over-optimism? So it might seem on the surface. In fact, Australia's long recession-free stretch may be the result of a rare case of decent economic planning. In 2010, when Australia's economy was still in overdrive, thanks to the massive stimulus-backed spending wave in China, Reserve Bank of Australia head Glenn Stevens gave a speech in which he expressed a widely felt sentiment: this isn't going to last forever. How to prepare for the inevitable decline in commodities prices? Some resource-rich countries have sovereign wealth funds; Australia demands a high personal savings rate through its superannuation pension system. Five years ago, Australia's terms of trade were so strong that one shipload of iron ore could purchase 22,000 flat-screen televisions, compared to 2,200 of the same only five years earlier. If the rise in income is only temporary, it would be desirable not to raise national consumption by very much, Stevens said. Instead, it would make sense to allow the income gain to flow into a higher stock of saving, which would then be able to fund future consumption. Which is exactly what Australia was doing. At that time, the net savings rate was 9 to 10 per cent of income, up from negative net savings before the commodities boom. For a few decades after the 1950s, analysts and economists hewed to the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, which holds that the price of primary products would only decline over time, relative to manufactured ones. Dead wrong, we know now, but it was in this period, under strong political leadership backed by a highly capable bureaucracy and an economically literate media, Australia determined to press ahead with productivity-increasing reforms, Stevens said. That these two phenomena occurred together was probably not entirely a coincidence, he said, referring to the effect of pessimism on the path of its economic planning. Besides limiting government debt and forcing a high private savings rate, Australia implemented tight financial regulations. In short, today's relative optimism in Australia is set on a foundation of past prudence. The pigeons earned their crests.

A case in point: China's official foreign-exchange reserves tumbled in November, as the People's Bank of China intervened heavily to prevent the yuan from falling even faster than it did versus the dollar. Total reserves declined 2.5% from October, and now stand at $3.44 trillion, more than half a trillion dollars below their June 2014 peak. Reserves have declined by an average of $50 billion a month over the past four months. Another half year like that, and China's reserves will be in danger of dropping below $3 trillion.

A 5% move up or down in the CSI 300 Index, a gauge of 300 stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, will trigger a 15-minute trading halt, according to a stock-exchange statement Friday. A movement of at least 7% will freeze trading for the rest of the day. The circuit breaker will kick in for trading that takes place up to 15 minutes before the markets close at 3 p.m. local time. Currently, China's stock regulators halt individual stocks that rise or fall 10% during the day.

The new rules will take effect Jan. 1. During the past year, the Shanghai Composite has logged an intraday rise or fall of more than 7% on nine separate occasions, according to FactSet. The mainland market surged as much as 151% in the 12 months to June this year, before plummeting 43% to a low in late August. A circuit-breaker mechanism can offer the markets a cooling-off period during extreme volatility, said Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, in a briefing Friday. It can help stabilize the market and protect market order and investors' interests, he said. The stock regulators' approval marks the latest effort to help mainland markets, notable for high turnover and lofty valuations, run more smoothly. The new rules put into motion a plan pitched by authorities in September. The announcement comes on the heels of a decision last month to relaunch initial public offerings after a halt during the summer selloff, a measure many interpreted as a vote of confidence in the market. Chinese shares entered a bull market in November, defined as a rise of 20% from a recent low. Yet reminders of the summer's volatility are fresh: The market fell 5.5% as recently as Nov. 27.

In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission overhauled its circuit breakers in the wake of the May 2010 flash crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1,000 points before quickly recovering.

{"title": "Earnings", "date": "7 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Plastics maker Covestro, formerly Bayer MaterialScience, remains optimistic about the China market despite the prolonged slowdown in construction and manufacturing activities that saw its third-quarter sales in the country drop 7 per cent year on year. The German firm was counting on diversification of its markets and product lines to hedge its risk amid volatile global economic conditions, chief financial officer Frank Lutz said. \u0093We are not dependent on one country and not on one product,\u0094 he said. \u0093We are still extremely happy with our business development in China \u0085 even if there is only 5 per cent growth in China for the next couple of years, it would still be a fantastic number for us as it is still a bigger growth rate than most of the regions [where] we have operations.\u0094 In the third quarter of this year, Covestro\u0092s China sales dropped 7 per cent year on year to \u00a4453 million (HK$3.8 billion), compared with 5 per cent growth in the United States to \u00a4680 million and a 2 per cent rise in Germany to \u00a4415 million. For the first nine months, its China sales grew 5 per cent while those in the US increased 4 per cent and Germany was flat. \u0093What we saw was that business confidence in China in the third quarter went down, so our customers released their stock [to their customers and cut purchases] \u0085 we don\u0092t think this is a general [trend] because once destocking has happened, our customers will start buying again,\u0094 Lutz said. \u0093It is a reflection of the uncertainty in the third quarter so that people got more cautious.\u0094 Covestro derived 22 per cent of its sales last year from the vehicle and transport sector, 19 per cent from construction, 18 per cent from furniture, 19 per cent from leisure, cosmetics and health, 13 per cent from electrical and electronics and 9 per cent from chemicals. Asia-Pacific accounted for 28 per cent of the company\u0092s global sales of \u00a411.7 billion last year, compared with 38 per cent from Europe, 22 per cent from North America and 12 per cent from South America, Africa and the Middle East. China accounted for 15 per cent of its global revenue. It spends about 2 per cent of its sales on research and development, which takes place in Shanghai, Texas in the US and Germany. Lutz said the firm remained optimistic about the China market despite the economic slowdown since the central government\u0092s pursuit of sustainable development and environmental protection created new demand for its products. They include polycarbonate, which is used in car parts to make vehicles lighter and more fuel-efficient while retaining strength and safety features, and polyurethane, which is used to make building insulation materials and stronger blades in wind turbines. Covestro is 69 per cent owned by German drugmaker Bayer, which has indicated a plan to completely divest its stake in Covestro after its separate listing on the stock market in October, without giving a time frame. The company raised US$1.7 billion from its initial public offering, 40 per cent less than the original target, amid a slump in global stock markets and a pollution-cheating scam at car giant Volkswagen, a major customer. The proceeds from the share sale were primarily intended to repay debt owed to Bayer so that the latter could have more resources to develop its health care and pesticide businesses. Lutz told German weekly Euro am Sonntag yesterday that Covestro intended to pay Bayer its outstanding debt of \u00a42 billion next year, Reuters reported. Finance chief Frank Lutz says Covestro is counting on diversification of its markets and product lines to hedge its risk. Photo: David Wong "}
{"title": "ENVIRONMENT", "date": "7 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. As international talks go into final week, Beijing should help overcome differences, activists say As foreign and environmental ministers head into the final stretch to agree on a global climate deal in Paris, some activist groups are urging China to play a more constructive role, saying Beijing could be a game changer in the second, final week of talks. Negotiators adopted a 48-page text on Saturday after the first week of discussions, which ended with clashes over whether more affluent developing countries should give financial aid to less developed ones, and whether to set a lower threshold for a temperature rise, as some island nations have proposed. At the talks, known as COP21, more than 190 nations are tasked with adopting a framework to limit carbon emissions to ensure global temperatures do not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, by 2100. Anything higher is expected to trigger extreme storms and flooding, longer heatwaves, and faster melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps \u0096 raising sea levels and plunging millions into poverty. In the coming days, ministers and negotiators are expected to engage in intense talks to eliminate the 939 differences remaining in the text. \u0093There is still hope for an ambitious deal to be reached, but there is also risk that countries will race to the bottom, which the French presidency has to prevent,\u0094 said Li Shuo, GreenpeaceChina\u0092s climate and energy campaigner. China\u0092s chief negotiator, Su Wei, said the text \u0093is only a basis for negotiation, there are several disagreements that we need to talk to each other about\u0094. In the first week, countries were divided on a number of issues such as whether wealthy developing countries should become potential donors to the Green Climate Fund, supplementing developed nations\u0092 obligatory input of financing for more vulnerable countries. Some developing countries are fine with the proposal. Vietnam, for example, announced on Saturday it would contribute US$1 million. Negotiators from India, however, argued such an arrangement would blur the existing separation between developing and developed countries enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. China has won abundant praise since announcing its goal to have carbon emissions peak by 2030. It has also offered to contribute US$3.1 billion to help other developing nations. But Beijing still has the potential \u0093to block any issues\u0094, according to Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute. \u0093China could be a real game changer in the upcoming talks. During the first week, China has aligned itself with Saudi Arabia on some issues,\u0094 Morgan said. \u0093We really hope that China could join the \u0091high ambition\u0092 coalition, and support the vulnerable island countries and least developed African countries.\u0094 Saudi Arabia was seen as the biggest blocker in the first week, rejecting calls by small island nations that the rise should be limited to 1.5 degrees. China \u0096 the world\u0092s biggest carbon emitter \u0096 and the United States prefer a target below 2 degrees, which would allow some room for future growth in carbon emissions. Beijing is also reluctant to put such wording as \u0093decarbonisation\u0094 or \u0093zero emissions\u0094 into the article on countries\u0092 long-term goals for tackling climate change. Saudi Arabia has also been accused of blocking the idea that the commitments countries have put on the table \u0096 covering emission cuts between 2020 and 2030 \u0096 should be reviewed before then and may be raised. Observers say China does not support reviewing national contributions ahead of 2020, as any increases and the resulting effects on its five-year plan would unsettle government officials. \u0093As on other diplomatic issues, China hates to be told by outsiders what to do or what not to do. It\u0092s pretty clear that the country feels more comfortable doing things at its own pace,\u0094 an observer said. China might also be uncomfortable about procedures to verify its domestic actions in the interests of transparency. "}

{"title": "MONEY MATTERS SHIRLEY YAM", "date": "5 December 2015", "body": "(c) 2015  South China Morning Post Publishers Limited, Hong Kong. All rights reserved. Hong Kong\u0092s regulatory regime is disclosure-based, which means buyer beware. But the approval for the listing of Bank of Jinzhou is too hard to swallow. The Liaoning-based bank is a \u0093showpiece\u0094 of all the ills of city banks in mainland China. Let us start with its aggressive, if not reckless, lending policy. One name tells all \u0096 Hanergy Group, which is under investigation by the Securities and Futures Commission after its spectacular fall from an eye-popping rally. By June 30, the bank had loaned 9.4 billion yuan (HK$11.4 billion) to Hanergy via all kinds of channels, except formal corporate lending. There was about six billion yuan via the so-called beneficial interest transfer plan \u0096 a popular conduit among small banks to get around regulator\u0092s interest rate and loan ratio controls. In return, Jinzhou got 7.6 per cent interest for six months. Like many of its peers, it went on to sell wealth management products on Hanergy to its clients to generate fee income. The shocking twist is Jinzhou ended up investing more than 3.4 billion yuan of its own money in these products. Only 70 per cent of these significant exposures were secured \u0096 with nothing more than Hanergy\u0092s shares. If impaired, the bank, which earned 2.1 billion yuan last year, would be mired in deep loss. The regulator rightfully doubted the bank\u0092s risk when it first applied for a listing in June. Miraculously, Jinzhou managed to halve the exposure within two months. Two \u0093independent\u0094 mainland financial institutions brought two billion yuan worth of the exposure at face value from Jinzhou. Hanergy paid back 2.6 billion yuan. Who would have been generous enough to take up loans at no discount when its own collateral was suspended shares of a company under investigation?
